1 PURPOSE 
 
• This guide in its design, development, implementation and review phases is guided and underpinned 
by the SARS Strategic Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25 and the applicable legislation. Should any aspect of 
this guide  conflict with the applicable legislation the applicable legislation will take precedence.  
 
• The purpose of this document is to assist employers in determining the amount of employees’ tax to 
be deducted from remuneration paid/payable according to the prescribed tax deduction tables.  
   
2 SCOPE 
 
• This basic guide is issued by the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to employers to assist them  
in calculating the amount of employees’ tax deductible from the remuneration including variable 
remuneration paid/payable to employees. It further explains the different methods that employers are 
allowed to apply  in this calculation process.  
 
3 PRESCRIBED TAX RATES  
 
Reference to the Act  Paragraphs 9(1), (2), 10 and 11 of the Fourth Schedule  
Sections 5 and 6 of the IT Act  
Section 27(1) of the Public Finance Management Act.  
 
Meaning The new tax rates chargeable shall be announced by the Minister of Finance in his / 
her National Annual Budget as contemplated in the Public Finance Act with effect 
from a date or dates mentioned in the announcement.  
 
Any changes with regard to the rates shall come into effect on the date or dates 
determined by the Minister of Finance in that announcement and continues to apply 
for a period of 12 months from that date.  
  
When to use the 
tables 
In the absence of a tax directive to the contrary as prescribed in Paragraphs 10 and 
11 of the Fourth Schedule, employers must make use of the deduction tables 
prescribed by the Commissioner or use the statutory rates as an alternative.  
 
Implementation of 
new rates of tax  
The new tax rates must be implemented by employers as soon as possible as 
contained in the Government Gazette by no later than 1  April of a tax year and 
employees' tax must be calculated according to these new rates.  
 
Any over deduction of employees' tax arising as a result of the implementation of 
new rates not in the employer’s possession on 1 March of each new tax year, may 
be refunded to the employee as soon as new rates (tables) are implemented.  
 
Any under deduction of employees' tax arising as a result of the implementation of 
new rates not in the employer’s possession on 1 March of the new tax year, may be 
adjusted over the remainder of the new tax year (from the date of implementation 
until 28 February). 
 
Employee leaves 
employment before 
introduction of new 
tables 
If an employee leaves your employment after 1  March of the new tax year but 
before the implementation of the new rates, the employees' tax deductions made in 
accordance with the previous rates are regarded as final.  
 
Rebates for individuals which are prescribed in section 6 of the Income Tax Act are 
deducted from the normal tax determined according to the statutory rates of tax.

5 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF TAX DEDUCTION PROGRAMS  
 
Differences 
between tables 
and tax programs  
Small differences may occur between the manual tables, and other computer 
programs based on the statutory rates of tax. These methods are acceptable in 
terms of the Income Tax Act provided that the results are within the provisions of 
this Act. 
Other computer 
programs 
Employers may use computer programs that render the same results, as the results 
that the employers receive when using the  statutory rates of tax.  
Where an employer use a computerised payroll or his/her/its own created payroll 
program, the instructions and guidelines as prescribed by SARS  must still be 
followed .
