With effect from 1 March 2011, the percentage rate for all employers - owned provided vehicles is 3.5 % per 
month of the vehicle’s determined value. However, vehicles with maintenance plans included within the

With effect from 1 March 2014, where the vehicle is acquired by the employer under an operating lease 
concluded at arm’s length and that are not connected persons in relation to each other, the value of a fringe 
benefit is the actual cost to the employer incurred under this lease plus the cost of fuel in respect of that vehicle.

FURTHER INFORMATION 
 
For more information

• Call the SARS Contact Centre on 0800 00SARS (7277), or  
• Visit your nearest SARS branch.  
 
 
2 PURPOSE 
 
• The purpose of this document is to assist employers in understanding their obligations relating to 
Employees’ Tax, Skills Development Levy (SDL) and Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) contributions. 
 
 
3 SCOPE 
 
• This basic guide is issued in terms of Paragraph 9(2) of the Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act No. 
58 of 1962. 
 
• This guide prescribes  the: 
 Employees’ tax deduction tables as contemplated in Paragraph 9(1) of the Fourth Schedule to the 
Income Tax Act;  
 Manner in which the tables must be applied by the employer.  
 
 
4 BACKGROUND 
 
What is employees’ tax • Where an employer pays or becomes liable to pay remuneration to an employee, the 
employer has an obligation to deduct or withhold employees’ tax from the remuneration 
and pay the tax deducted or withheld to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) on 
a monthly basis. In most instances, the employer is obliged to issue each employee with 
an employees’ tax certificate [IRP5/IT3 (a)] at the end of each tax period which reflects, 
amongst other details, the employees’ tax deducted.  
• These subjects are fully dealt with later in this guide. In addition thereto, the employer is 
obliged to submit an Employer Reconciliation Declaration (EMP501) to SARS . 
• In terms of Paragraph 3 of the Fourth Schedule, employees’ tax receives preference 
over any other deduction from the employee’s remuneration which the employer has a 
right or is obliged to deduct otherwise than in terms of any law.  
• Any reference to the start date and end date of a tax period is 1 March and 28/29 
February. This guide will include the start and end date s of 2nd alternate period. An 
alternate period is normally determined at the option of the employer which  may be 
exercised in relation to all employees or any class of employee.  Where an employer 
adopts the so -called alternate period, any remuneration paid to an employee during such 
alternate period is regarded as having been paid to him/her during the corresponding 
tax year. 
 
What is SDL • This is a compulsory levy scheme for the purposes of funding education and training as 
envisaged in the Skills Development Act, 1998. This levy came into operation on 1 April 
2000 and is payable by employers on a monthly basis.   
 
What are UIF 
contributions  
• This is a compulsory contribution to fund unemployment benefits. Since 1 April 2002, 
the contributions deducted and payable by employers on a monthly basis have been 
collected by SARS and are paid over to the UIF which is managed by the UI 
Commissioner .  
 
Liability of 
representative employer

period is shorter 
than a full tax 
year 
 
 
 
Paragraphs 9(1) and 9(2) of the Fourth Schedule  
Applicable Tax Deduction  Tables 
  
• An annual equivalent  must be determined when an employee's tax period is shorter than     a

Total remuneration received/accrued  X
  
Total pay period s in tax year 
      Total pay period s worked

liable for tax on the ann ual equivalent, but for the pro-rata po rtion which represents the 
employees’ tax dedu ctible on the remuneration which was actually received or accrued. 
This is don e by dividing it by the ratio which a full year bears to the period s in respect of 
which the remuneration was received or accrued.

• Deduction is calculated on the balance of remuneration after the deduction of all allowable 
deductions ( e.g. Retirement annuity  fund contribution, provident fund contribution, pension 
fund contribution  and  donations ).  
 
• For various reasons, employees may find that they have to pay in fairly large amounts upon 
receipt of their assessments. To reduce the amount payable on assessment or avoid having 
to pay in an additional amount, such employees may request (in writing) thei r employers to 
deduct from their remuneration a greater amount of employees’ tax than is required.  
 
• Employer and employee may under no circumstances conclude an agreement whereby 
employer undertakes not to deduct or withhold employees’ tax or UIF contributions. Such 
agreement is void in terms of Paragraph 7 of Fourth Schedule.  
 
• The employer must remit the amount deducted or withheld to SARS with his/her Monthly

to the provisions of section 8C and the swap is a non -event. (applies to acquisitions 
occurring on or after 1 January 2011 ); 
 An anti -avoidance provision was included to guard against situations where co -
employees and directors collude to avoid the deferment of taxation that section 8C 
achieves. With effect from 1 January 2011, rollover treatment will apply to equity 
instruments acquired from employees or directors of same employer.  
• Any amount received by or accrued to a taxpayer during year of assessment relating 
to a restricted equity instrument must be included in taxpayer’s income, if that amount 
does not constitute:  
 A return of capital or foreign return of capital by way of distribution of a restricted equity 
instrument; or  
 A dividend or foreign dividend in respect of that equity instrument; or  
 Any amount that must be taken into account for purposes of calculating a gain or loss for 
purposes of section 8C . 
 
• Any equity instrument which was previously taxed and subsequently acquired by the 
exercise or conversion of, or in exchange for the disposal of any other equity instrument is 
excluded.  
• Any capital gain arising from the disposal of an asset by a trust and a trust beneficiary  
(employee)  has a vested right to an amount derived from th at capital gain, th e trust must 
exclude any amount which is already been included in the income of the  trust beneficiary 
in terms of section 8 C. This exclusion is deemed to have come into operation with effect 
from 1 March 2017.   
• This section in effect, exempts from tax the benefit that is commonly called the stop loss 
benefit that can accrue in terms of share incentive schemes.  
 
• An equity instrument acquired is deemed to vest in the case of : 
 An unrestricted equity instrument, when the employee acquires it.  
 A restricted equity instrument, at the earliest of: 
o When all relevant restrictions cease;  
o Immediately  
▪ Before employee disposes of it (except for disposals discussed hereunder);  
▪ After it terminates (if it is an option);  
▪ Before employee dies if all restrictions relating to that equity instrument are or 
may be lifted on or after death;  
o At the time of disposal where the equity instrument is disposed  of for an amount 
less than the market value or where disposal by way of release, abandonment  or 
lapse of an option or financial instrument occurs.  
 
• The gain to be included in the income of the taxpayer , in the case of : 
 A disposal, the amount received or accrued in respect of that disposal which exceeds 
the sum of any consideration in respect of that equity instrument;  
 Any other, the sum of: 
• Amount by which the market value of the equity instrument determined at the time that 
it vests in that employee exceeds the sum of any consideration in respect of that equity 
instrument;  
 Excess  amount (if any) which exceeds the consideration in respect of the restricted 
equity instrument where the consideration includes an amount  other than restricted 
equity instruments . 
  
• In the case of a disposal  - the amount by which the sum of any consideration in respect 
of that equity instrument exceeds that amount received or accrued in respect of that 
disposal;  
• In any other case  - the amount by which the consideration in respect of the equity 
instrument exceeds the market value of that equity instrument determined at that time 
that it vests in that taxpayer . 
 
• Where the taxpayer (employee or director) disposes an acquired restricted equity 
instrument to any person by either a non -arm’s length disposal or the disposal to a 
connected person this will not be regarded as vesting of the equity instrument and will 
not attract a taxable gain or loss. The vesting event (i.e. a gain or loss) will continue to 
remain in the hands of the employee/director.  
• The time of disposal of an equity instrument is the time that the equity instrument vests 
in the beneficiary as contemplated in section 8C.

Deemed independent 
contractor 
 
 
 
Exceptions 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Income earned by an independent contractor is specifically excluded from the definition of 
remuneration in Paragraph 1 of the Fourth Schedule  
 
• In distinguishing between an employee and an independent contractor / trader on e must 
commence with an analysis of the employment con tract.  
• The object of the con tract (or the parties' righ ts and obligations under the contract) 
must be established . 
 The object of the con tract is no t a mere indicator, but determines the legal nature of 
the con tract.  
 The object to be established is the pre-eminen t object, for example, if the object is the 
surrende r of productive capacity (whether capacity to provide a service or to produce 
thing s), then the con tract is for employment of an employee.  
 The essence of an employee’s con tract (con tract of service) is the placing of one 
person’s services (labour) at the disposal of ano ther, enabling the acquisition of that 
service itself and no t simply the fruits of that produ ctive capacity. 
• If the object is the acquisition of the result of dep loyed produ ctive capacity (of a 
produ ced thing or of a provided service), then the con tract is for the employment of an 
independen t contractor. The essence of an independen t con tractor’s con tract (contract 
for services or work) is that the independen t contractor only commits himself/herself to 
deliver the produ ct or end result of that capacity. 
 
• The person will be deemed to be an independen t con tractor if he/she throughout 
the year of assessment employs three or more employees (other than any employee 
who is a con nected person in relation to such person) who are on a full-time basis 
engage in the business of persons rendering any such service and providing that 
neither of the above two proviso’s under exception s are app licable 
 
• The Fourth Schedule  prescribes that the independ ent contractor’s income will be 
deemed to be remuneration and will therefore be subject to Employees’ Tax, if — 
 The services are required to be performed mainly at the premises of the person by whom  
the remuneration is paid/payable or of the person to whom such services were or are to 
be rendered;  
 The person who renders or will render the service is subject to the control and 
supervision of any other person as to the manner in which his/her  duties are performed 
or to be performed or as to his/her hours of work

Employee definition in Paragraph 1 of the Fourth Schedule  
Paragraph 2(1) of the Fourth Schedule ,  Section 7B  
Definition of a company in Section 1  
 
• The definition of employee includes a director of a private company.  
 Any remuneration paid or payable to a director of a private company or a member of 
a close corporation is therefore subject to the deduction of Employees’ Tax from 1 
March 2002. 
• The definition of a company includes a close corporation and therefore, the same rules 
for the deduction of employees’ tax from the remuneration of directors of private 
companies apply to members of close corporations.  
This  definition includes a person who, in respect of a close corporation, holds any office 
or performs any functions similar to the functions of a director of a company other than a 
close corporation . 
• Effective from 01 March 2017, any variable remuneration  received by a director  will 
accrue on the date on which it is paid  to the director.  
 
• The employer has the right to recover the PAYE on the deemed remuneration paid by 
the compan y from the director. This recovery may, in add ition to any other righ t of 
recovery, be recovered from any amoun t which is or may become payable by the 
compan y to the director. The director is no t entitled to receive anIRP5/IT3(a) in respect 
of the amoun t of employees’ tax paid by the company on the deemed remuneration if 
the company has no t recovered the employees’ tax from the director. 
 
• Where  the person ceases to be a director but remains an employee of the company, 
section 7B  wi l l  no longer be used and PAYE must be deducted from remuneration that 
is actually paid or is payable to the employee. Only on e IRP5/IT3(a) needs to be issued 
for the year. 
 
• Where  a person is appo inted as a director of a private compan y during the tax year and 
the director was no t previously an employee of that company, PAYE will be payable on 
the actual r emuneration which is paid or i s payable to the director during that tax 
year. 
• The remuneration shown must be the amount of actual remuneration which is paid / 
payable to the director for the tax year.  
• The amount of PAYE will be the sum of the PAYE that was deducted from the actual 
remuneration of the director and the PAYE paid by the company in respect of the deemed 
remuneration of that director.  
 
• Salaries paid to directors reflect under code 3615 (only applicable from 2003 to 2018 years 
of assessment) and all other components of the remuneration (bonus, allowance, benefits, 
etc.) must be reflected against the existing codes.  Code 3601 must be used from 2019 
year of assessment.  
 
• The director ’s fees received by a resident NED are not regarded as remuneration and 
the employer is not obligated to deduct/withhold employees’ tax. The director can request 
a voluntary deduction of employees’ tax.  
 If the voluntary deduction is requested, then this income must reflect unde r cod e 3620 
on the IRP5/IT3(a) certificate .

Definition of  “remuneration” in Paragraph 1 of the Fourth Schedule  
 
• Is remuneration as defined and is fully subject to deduction of employees’ tax.  
 Leave days accrue as an employee works. Employees are allowed to encashment of 
value of accrued leave without actually taking leave - this encashment constitutes taxable 
remuneration.  
 Only when leave is paid it is included in remuneration of employee. No value is placed 
on accrued leave until the encashment thereof . 
 Unpaid leave taken or forfeited leave do not constitute remuneration, as there is no value 
attached thereto .  
 
• Can be paid to an employee, and thus become taxable remuneration, when:  
 Employee dies and accrued leave is paid to the employee’s estate;  
 Employment is terminated for any reason,  e.g. retirement, resignation;  
 Is encashed for any reason, such as when too much leave has accrued;  
 Employee becomes insolvent;  or 
 It is encashed due to internal arrangements  e.g. employee is appointed in a more senior 
post or promoted . 
• Leave pay is a payment in respect of services rendered and does not form part of a 
severance benefit  
 
• The fact that an employee has taken unpa id leav e of any type (including maternity 
leave), has no effect on the employee’s tax period . 
 The tax period continues until the end of the tax year, unless the employee resigns or 
dies before the end of the tax year. 
 When the tax period does end and the final tax calculation is performed to calculate 
PAYE, it will be foun d that the employee has probably paid too much Employees’ 
Tax due to he/she being absent withou t pay during the tax period . 
 
• Must be calculated differently on leave that is taken where an advance is paid and 
accrued leave that is encashed: 
 Where leave is taken and an advance is paid for leave period, the advance mus t 
be treated as advanced salary;  
 Accrued leave that is encashed must be tax ed in same manner as a bonus . 
 
• Accrued leave which has been encashed must reflect unde r code  3605 if it accrued as 
a result of encashment or resignation . 
 If a tax directive application was submitted, code 3907 on the tax directive must then be 
reflected on the certificate as well as the tax directive number.

• An annual payment is an amount : 
 Of net remuneration that is, in accordance with the employee’s conditions of service or the 
employer’s practice, paid in a lump sum to the employee; or

prior to the end of the contract period, the Employees’ Tax paid on this a mount may under 
no circumstances be refunded to the employee.  
 
• The employees’ tax on an annual payment is basically determined by calculating the 
annual equivalent of the remuneration earned during the tax period by the employee and

• Tax on annual payment spread over the tax year:  The same figures as in the previous 
example are used.  The employee is for the full year in employment of the employer. The 
tax on the bonu s must be calculated at the beginn ing of the employee’s tax period and 
then spread over the remainde r of the pay periods of the employee for the specific tax year.

employee the exemption shall not apply if the following cond ition s are present:  
 In the case of a scholarship or bursary granted to employee to enable or assist any such 
employee, unless the employee agrees to reimburse the employer for any scholarship 
or bursary granted to him/her if he/she fails to complete his/her  studies for reasons other 
than death, ill -health or injury;  
 In the case of a scholarship or bursary granted to enable or assist any such relative of 
an employee to study, if the remuneration proxy derived by the employee during the tax 
year exceeded R600,000; and  
 To so much of a bursary as in the case of such relative  exceeded R20,000 during the 
year of assessment for : 
o Grade R to grade twelve as contemplated in definition of ‘school’ in section 1 of South 
African Schools Act, 1996 (Act No. 84 of 1996);  or 
o A qualification to which an NQF level from 1 up to and including 4 has been allocated 
in accordance with Chapter 2 of National Qualifications Framework Act, 2008 (Act No. 
67 of 2008); and  
o R60,000 in respect of  higher  education (NQF level 5 up to 10) .   
 
• The taxable benefit of a bursary is regarded as an annual payment for PAYE 
purpo ses. 
 
• It is only the taxable portion of bursaries that must reflect under codes 3809  for grade 
R to 12 and NQF level 1 to 4 and 3820 for NQF levels 5 to 10.  
• The non -taxable portion of bursaries must reflect  under codes 3815  for grade R to 12  
and 3821 NQF levels 5 to 10 . 
 
• Expendi ture in conne ction with internal or on-the-job training or courses presented 
by other institutions on behalf of the employer, doe s no t represent a taxable benefit in

• The following are examples of this type of training: 
 Computer and word processing courses;  
 Management and administration courses;  
 Bookkeeping courses;  
 Sales courses;  
 Courses in operating office and technical equipment; and  
 Language  courses for employees.  
 
• To the extent that a bon a fide bursary does no t qualify for the exemption , it is taxable in 
the employee’s han ds. 
• The following is an ind ication of bursaries and study loan s that will be taxed as a 
fring e benefit: 
 Low-interest or interest -free loans granted by the employer to further the employee’s 
studies are not regarded as bursaries, but as low or interest -free loans upon which no 
value is placed;  
 Where the employee is not required to repay the loan, he/she will have received a taxable 
benefit in terms of Paragraph 2(h) of the Seventh Schedule (payment of employee’s debt 
or release employee from obligation to pay debt) and employees’ tax must be deducted.  
 This  taxable benefit is seen as an annual payment for PAYE purposes;  
 Where an employer rewards an employee for obtaining a qualification, successful 
completion of a study course or reimburses the employee for study expenses, such 
reward or reimbursement of study expenses will represent, in the case of the reward, 
taxable remuneration and in the case of the reimbursement of study expenses, a taxable 
benefit in terms of Paragraph 2(h) of the Seventh Schedule (payment of employees debt 
or release employee from obligation to pay debt);  
 Only the taxable portion of bursaries paid to an employee or a family member of an 
employee is subject to the deduction of employees’ tax;  
 Any bursary, which is granted subject to the condition of repayment, due to non-fulfilment 
of conditions stipulated in a written agreement, will be treated as a bona fide bursary until 
such time as the non -compliance provisions of the agreement are invoked .  
 In the tax year in which such provisions are invoked, the amount of the bursary will be 
regarded as a loan and any benefit which an employee may have received by way of an 
interest -free or low -interest loan will constitute a taxable benefit in terms of Par agraph 
2(f) of the Seventh Schedule.

 The question of whether an employee will qualify for the exemption or not is a question 
of fact that can be answered once the requisite number of days has been met.   
 Directives are therefore not issued for such taxpayers.  
• Where the employer is satisfied that the employee will meet the necessary  criteria for the 
exemption to be granted, the employer is at liberty not to deduct Employees’ Tax provided 
that a copy of each page of the  employee’s passport and a copy of the relevant contract 
for the services to  be rendered in a foreign country are kept.  
 Should it transpire that the employee does not qualify for the exemption; the employer will be     
held personally liable for any losses that SARS may suffer due to the non-deduction of the full 
amount of employees’ tax.
