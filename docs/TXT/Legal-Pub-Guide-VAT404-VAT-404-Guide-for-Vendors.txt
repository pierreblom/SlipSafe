VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors 10 Important principles 
 
 
 i 
10 Important principles 
1. All prices charged, advertised or quoted by a vendor must include VAT at the applicable 
rate (currently 15% for standard-rated supplies). 
2. Vendors are charged with the responsibility of levying VAT and paying it over to the State 
after deducting permissible VAT inputs and other deductions – please make sure that you 
pay it over on time, otherwise penalties and interest will be charged. 
3. VAT charged on supplies made (output tax) less VAT paid to your suppliers (input tax) and 
other permissible deductions = the amount of VAT payable/refundable. 
4. You need to be in possession of documentary proof prescribed by or which is acceptable 
to the Commissioner to substantiate any input tax and/or other permissible deductions 
which you want to make. You must also keep records of all your documentary proof an d 
other records of transactions for at least five years. 
5. Goods exported to clients in an export country (any country outside of the Republic) may 
be charged with VAT at 0%. However, if delivery takes place in the Republic, you must 
charge VAT at the standard rate to your client, unless the goods are supplied und er 
Sections A and B of Part  Two of the Export Regulations which allow the zero rate to be 
applied, subject to certain requirements, at the discretion of the supplier. This discretion 
may only be applied when the goods are to be exported via road or rail or are delivered to 
a harbour or an airport from where the goods will be exported. If VAT is charged at the 
standard rate and your client is a vendor, your client may deduct the VAT charged as input 
tax. If your client is not a vendor, and the goods are subs equently removed from the 
Republic, a claim for a refund of the VAT may be submitted to the VAT Refund 
Administrator (the VRA), subject to certain requirements being met. 
6. You may not register for VAT if you only make exempt supplies. If you are registered, 
because you make both taxable and non -taxable supplies, you may not deduct any VAT 
charged on goods or services acquired to make exempt supplies or for private use or other 
non-taxable purposes. Also, as a general rule, any VAT incurred to acquire a motor car or 
goods or services acquired for purposes of entertainment may not be deducted, even if 
used for making taxable supplies. 
7. You are required to advise the South African Revenue Service (SARS) within 21  days of 
any changes in your registered particulars, including any change in your representative, 
business address, banking details, trading name or if you cease trading. 
8. If you have underpaid VAT as a result of a mistake, report it to SARS as soon as possible, 
rather than leaving it for the SARS auditors to detect. You can make a request for 
correction on eFiling if you file your returns electronically. Otherwise, approach  your 
nearest SARS office for assistance. 
9. You can pay your VAT electronically by using eFiling or by making an electronic funds 
transfer (EFT) through internet banking. You may also pay at certain banks. 
10. Report fraudulent activities to SARS by calling the Fraud and Anti -Corruption Hotline on 
0800 00 28 70. You may report an incident anonymously if you wish. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Preface

Preface 
The VAT 404 is a basic guide where technical and legal terminology ha s been avoided 
wherever possible. Although fairly comprehensive, the guide does not deal with all the legal 
detail associated with VAT and is not intended for legal reference. 
All references to sections hereinafter are to section s of the Value-Added Tax Act 89 of 1991 
(VAT Act), unless the context indicates otherwise. The Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011, the 
Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 and the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964 are referred to as the 
“TA Act”, “Income Tax Act” and “Customs and Excise Act” respectively. The terms “Republic”, 
“South Africa” or the abbreviation “RSA”, are used interchangeably in this document as a 
reference to the sovereign territory of the Republic of South Africa, as set out in the definition 
of “Republic” in section 1(1). You will also find a number of specific terms used throughout the 
guide which are defined in the VAT Act and the TA Act listed in the Glossary in a simplified 
form for easy reference.  
The information in this guide is based on the VAT Act and the TA Act as at the time of 
publishing and includes the latest amendments contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment 
Act, 17 of 2023, the Tax Administration Laws Amendment Act, 18 of 2023 and the Rates and 
Monetary Amounts and Amendment of Revenue Laws  Act, 19 of 2023. These Acts were all 
promulgated on 22 December 2023 as per Government Gazettes (GGs) 49894, 49947 and 
49948 respectively.  
Some of the more important amendments that have been introduced since the previous issue 
of this guide are discussed briefly below. 
The following amendments came into effect from 1 April 2023 unless otherwise stated: 
• Cross border leases of foreign owned parts – In 2020 proviso (xiii) to the definition of 
“enterprise” was inserted to clarify that a non -resident lessor is not regarded as 
carrying on an enterprise in the Republic when foreign-owned ships, aircraft or rolling 
stock are leased for use in the Republ ic, subject to certain conditions being met. The 
scope of this proviso has now been extended to include the leasing of foreign -owned 
parts relating to such foreign -owned ships, aircraft or rolling stock if those pa rts are 
leased under a separate agreement. See the article “Non -resident lessors of ships, 
aircraft and rolling stock under a rental agreement” in VAT Connect (Issue 12) for more 
information on the requirements. 
• Flash title sales – Before this amendment, non-resident entities that take ownership of 
goods in South Africa on a flash title basis and immediately on-sell such goods to other 
non-resident entities (customers) for export by the customers were regarded as 
carrying on an enterprise in South Africa. This approach was applied even if the non-
resident had no intention to carry out any other commercial activity in South Africa. 
A new proviso (xiv) was therefore inserted into the definition of “enterprise” to exclude 
the activities of a “qualifying purchaser” (QP1) supplying goods to another “qualifying 
purchaser” under a “flash title” as defined in the Export Regulation published in 
Government Gazette (GG) 37580 of 2 May 2014 (the Export Regulation). QP1 must 
be a non -resident non -registered vendor, that acquires goods from a vendor and 
merely takes ownership of the goods in South Africa for a moment in time. The new 
dispensation is subject to QP1 complying with the do cumentary requirements 
prescribed in regulation 10 of the Export Regulation.

• Repossessions and surrender – Section 20(8) previously dealt with documentation in 
connection with second -hand goods, and repossessions and surrender of goods 
previously supplied under an instalment credit agreement. Section 20(8) has now been 
amended to apply only to the supply of second-hand goods. Section 20(8A) has been 
introduced to specifically deal with the documentary requirements for repossessions 
or surrender of goods under section  8(10). Consequential amendments have also 
been made to section  16(2)(c) to include the documentation referred to under 
section 20(8A). See the article “Documentary requirements for repossession and 
surrender of goods” in VAT Connect (Issue 16 ) for a further discussion on this 
amendment. 
• Temporary letting of dwellings by developers – On 1 April 2022, new provisions in the 
form of sections 9(13), 10(29), 16(3)(o) and 18D were introduced to deal with dwelling 
units that have been developed for sale by a developer, and such dwellings are 
temporarily let for exempt residential use whilst the developer continues to pursue a 
taxable intention of selling the units. Fur ther technical amendments have been made 
to provide clarity. The time of supply under section  9(13) is now triggered in the tax 
period in which the agreement for letting and hiring of the dwelling comes into effect or 
when the dwelling is occupied, whichever occurs first. Technical corrections were also 
made to section 16(2)(f) and section 16(3)(o). These amendments have retrospective 
effect, applicable from 1  April 2022. For further information on this topic see Binding 
General Ruling  64 “Temporary Application of New Dwellings for Exempt Supplies 
Simultaneously held by Developers for Taxable Purposes”  (BGR 64) and the further 
amendments effective from 1 April 2024 discussed below.  
• Pooling arrangements – A new subsection (3) was inserted into section 52 to allow for 
pooling arrangements in industries other than agriculture and property rental. This new 
provision is intended to deal with the VAT treatment of pooling arrangements 
established as a manner of complying with the provisions of legislation, regulations or 
rules of a professional body. The provision only applies to persons that are subject to 
such legislation, regulations or rules of such professional body. There are also certain 
conditions that apply, for example, joint and several liability will be applicable. 
This provision can be applied, for example, to medical pools. In such a case, the 
medical pool may be deemed to be separate from its members and may be registered 
as a vendor. This allows the medical pool to account for the VAT of the members as 
opposed to regi stering each individual medical practitioner governed by Health 
Professions Council of South Africa that forms part of the pool. 
• Registration of foreign entities – Section 23(2A) is a new provision aimed at alleviating 
the administrative difficulty for foreign entities required to register for VAT in South 
Africa. If one or more foreign entities forming part of the same “group of companies” 
as defined under section 1(1) of the Income Tax Act are required to register for VAT, 
section 23(2A) allows for a single branch VAT registration for all those separate 
entities. This firstly requires that one of the entities in the group must alre ady be 
conducting an enterprise in South Africa and be registered as a vendor (main 
registered vendor). The main registered vendor may then register a separate branch 
or division for all the foreign entities. The primary purpose of the separate registration 
is to ensure that a distinction can be drawn between the supplies made by the main 
registered vendor and the other foreign entities. The main vendor must submit a VAT 
return to account for its own VAT and a separate VAT return must be submitted for the 
branch or division to account for the VAT of all the other entities. The normal VAT rules 
apply to supplies made between entities in the same group and if those supplies form 
part of their enterprise activities in the Republic, the VAT on such supplies must  be 
accounted for in the VAT return submitted for the branch or division. There are certain 
conditions that apply, for instance, the branch will be treated as an enterprise separate 
from the main registered vendor and the Commissioner may cancel the branch  
registration under specified circumstances. Any of the non-resident group companies 
may, however, elect to register independently as a vendor in South Africa, and not 
form part of the branch registration under the new dispensation.

• Swaziland name change – Textual amendments have been made to section 13(1)(iii), 
section 13(2)(b), Schedule 1 to the VAT Act and Item 412 to reflect the name change 
of Swaziland to eSwatini.  
• Registration of foreign electronic service providers – A new proviso was inserted into 
section 23(1A) with effect from 5  January 2023 to provide that a foreign electronic 
services provider is not required to register as a vendor if the total value of taxable 
supplies of R1 million in any consecutive 12-month period has been exceeded solely 
as a consequence of abnormal circumstances of a temporary nature. The amendment 
is aimed at achieving parity with the concession granted to local vendors. 
The following amendments came into effect from 1 April 2024 unless otherwise stated: 
• Definition of “enterprise”  – A new proviso (xv) was inserted into the definition of 
“enterprise” in section 1(1) to provide that the activities of the Corporation for Deposit 
Insurance which was established under section 166AE of the Financial Sector 
Regulation 9 of Act, shall, to the extent that it makes supplies of deposit insurance as 
contemplated in section 166AF(1) of that Act, be deemed not to be the carrying on of 
an enterprise.  
• Financial services – A textual amendment was made to update the definition of the 
term “derivative” in section 2(2)(iiiA) so that it now aligns to International Financial 
Reporting Standard 9  (IFRS 9) issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board. This amendment has retrospective effect, applicable from 1 January 2024. 
• Short-term insurance  – The proviso’s to section 8(8) have been reworded and 
individually numbered to deal with ongoing interpretation difficulties and practical 
application of the law in the insurance industry regarding the settlement of claims under 
a contract of insurance. In terms of the amendments, it is clarified that the deemed 
supply in section 8(8) only arises in respect of  cash indemnity payments made to, or 
on behalf of, the insured party under a contract of insurance. A new section 8(8A) has 
also been introduced to deal exclusively with the effect of the reinstatement of the 
actual goods or services covered in the policy to the extent that the claim will not be 
settled by way of a cash payment as contemplated in section 8(8). Under section 8(8A) 
the third-party supplier that supplies the reinstated goods or services is deemed to 
make a supply to both the insurer and the insured to the extent that each party is liable 
to make a payment towards the consideration for that supply. If the third-party supplier 
is a vendor, then a tax invoice must be issued to both the insurer and the insured 
parties, to the extent that each party has paid, or is liable to pay a consideration for the 
goods or services to be reinstated. The effect is that the input tax deduction allowed to 
the insurer and the insured will be limited to the extent of the respective trade and 
excess payments made, as evidenced by way of the tax invoices. The amendments 
are aligned to current industry practice  and BGR 14 “VAT Treatment of Specific 
Supplies in the Short-Term Insurance Industry” (BGR 14) published on 22 May 2024. 
The amendments come into effect from 1 January 2024. 
• Temporary letting of dwellings by developers  – On 1 April 2022 certain amendments 
to section 18D and related provisions (as discussed above) came into effect . 
(See BGR 64 for more details in this regard.) As a result of continued difficulties 
identified with the application of section 18D, it was necessary for further amendments 
to be made.  The first amendment is to section 10(29), which now provides that the 
consideration for the deemed supply under section 18D(2) is equal to the adjusted cost 
to the vendor of the fixed property (including the value of the land) and not merely the 
adjusted cost of the construction, extension or improvements made. The second 
amendment was the deletion of section  18D(5)(c) as that  provision does not find 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Preface 
 
 v 
application in any circumstances. The third amendment was the introduction of a new 
section 18D(6) to clarify that if the temporary letting period exceeds 12 months or the 
property is permanently applied for a non -taxable purpose, then an adjustment must 
be made under section 18(1) and not under section 18D(2). There is also a transitional 
rule in the proviso to section  18(6), which provides for a situation in which a written 
sale agreement is concluded during the temporary letting period of 12 months and the 
transfer of the property only occurs after the 12-month period has expired. In such a 
case, the output tax adjustment under section 18(1) will not apply when the 12-month 
period expires. Instead, the sale of the property will continue to be a  taxable supply 
under section 7(1)(a) as per the sale agreement that was concluded during the period 
of temporary application of the dwelling for exempt supplies. The developer will, in that 
case, account for output tax on the  sale of the dwelling at the time contemplated  in 
section 9(3)(d). (That is, on date of registration of transfer of the property in the Deeds 
Registry or the date on which any payment in respect of the consideration for the 
supply is made, whichever is earlier. ) BGR 64 was published on 22  May 2024 to 
incorporate these amendments. See 9.6.2 and the VAT 409 – Guide for Fixed Property 
and Construction for further information on this topic.  
• Credit notes – telecommunications industry – A new provision has been inserted in the 
form of section 21(1)(f) to allow a VAT-registered and licensed telecommunications 
service provider to issue a credit note in certain circumstances where the nature of the 
supply has been fundamentally varied or altered subsequent to the issuing of a prepaid 
voucher under section 10(19) for future services to be rendered.  In such a case the 
output tax on the full value of the telecommunications service must be declared at the 
time the voucher is issued. This amendment deals with the difficulty that arises when 
the telecommunications supplier accounts for VAT on the full consideration for the 
supply, but later, part or all of that customer’s credit in respect of the unutilised portion 
of the service is used to pay a third-party on behalf of their customer for the supply of 
other goods or services . In such instances, the telecommunications supplier acts as 
an agent for their customer in allowing the credit to be used as payment to  the third-
party supplier. The telecommunications supplier may now issue a credit note under 
section 21 of the VAT Act  as specified in BGR  72 and claim the corresponding input 
tax. The amendment addresses the inequity that arises as a result of the payment of 
output tax on that part of the telecommunications service that will never be supplied.  
See BGR 72 for further details on the particulars which must be contained in the credit 
note issued by the telecommunications company to the prepaid subscriber in terms of 
section 21(1)(f).  
• Documentary requirements for gold exports – In the gold refining or smelting process, 
the gold of various depositors is co -mingled and each depositor’s gold cannot be 
separately identified. As a result, after the refining process, and once the gold is sold 
or exported, depositors experience difficulty in obtaining the documentary evidence 
required under the Export Regulation, to substantiate the zero-rating of certain exports. 
In order to combat this difficulty, section  54(2C) was introduced to allow an agent 
(being a vendor) that supplies or exports gold on behalf of a principal (being a vendor) 
that meets the conditions in section  54(2C) to retain the required documentation 
instead of the principal. If the agent is not in possession of the required documentation, 
the agent will be liable to account for output tax at the standard rate on the supply of 
the gold. See BGR 69 for information on the documentation to be retained by the agent. 
Lastly, the Domestic Reverse Charge Regulations relating to certain transactions involving 
gold and other “valuable metals”  was published  as Notice 2140  in GG 46512 dated 
8 June 2022 (the DRC  Regulations). Further amendments to the DRC Regulations were 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Preface 
 
 vi 
promulgated on 10  May 2024 as published in Government Gazette  50642. The DRC 
Regulations, which came into effect from 1 August 2022, essentially provide that the recipient 
of the supply of valuable metal must account for the VAT on the supply instead of the supplier 
and that certain additional information to this effect must appear on any tax invoice issued in 
respect of a supply falling within the ambit of the DRC Regulations. The duties and 
responsibilities of the affected suppliers and recipients are prescribed in the DRC Regulations 
and further explained in the associated Explanatory Memorandum. The SARS website has 
been updated with further information which is available on the VAT Domestic Reverse Charge 
landing page, including Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs. See also VAT Connect 14.  
The following amendments to the DRC Regulations came into effect from 1 April 2024 unless 
otherwise stated: 
• Definition of “residue”  – The definition has been amended to clarify that the term 
“residue” is specifically in relation to mining operations carried on by a holder of a 
mining right or a person contracted to the holder and does not include the general 
concept of residue.  
• Definition of “valuable metal” – The definition has been amended to eliminate confusion 
and clarify that the goods which contain gold must be in certain prescribed forms, that 
is, jewellery, bars, coins, etc. Th e definition has also been expanded to align to the 
Precious Metals Act 37 of 2005 and includes goods in the form of sponge or powder 
containing gold.  
• De minimus rule – the definition of “valuable metal” was amended to exclude the supply 
of valuable metal containing less than 1% of gold in gross weight and a supply of gold-
plated jewellery where the gold is present as a minor constituent only.  Therefore, the 
DRC Regulations will no longer apply to these supplies and the normal VAT rules will 
apply.  
• Responsibilities of the supplier and recipient – As the recipients may not always be in 
a position to determine the gold content of the “valuable metal” supplied to them, 
regulations 2 and 3 have been amended to transfer the responsibility for declaring the 
percentage of the gold content in a “valuable metal” supplied, from the recipient to the 
supplier of the “valuable metal”. 
• Effective date – The effective date of the Regulations is 1 January 2024.

VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 1 
 
 1 
Chapter 1  
Introduction 
1.1 What is VAT? 
VAT is an abbreviation for the term value-added tax. It is an indirect tax based on consumption 
in the economy. Revenue is raised for the government by requiring certain traders (vendors) 
to register and charge VAT on taxable supplies of goods or services  for the benefit of the 
National Revenue Fund and to pay it over to the government after deducting permissible VAT 
inputs and other deductions.F
4 SARS is a government agency which administers the VAT Act 
and ensures that the tax is collected and that the VAT law is properly enforced. 
The generally accepted essential characteristics of a VAT type tax are as follows: 
• The tax applies generally to transactions related to goods or services. 
• It is proportional to the price charged for the goods or services. 
• It is charged at each stage of the production and distribution process. 
• The taxable person (vendor) may deduct the tax paid during the preceding stages on 
goods or services acquired (that is, the burden of the tax is on the final consumer). 
VAT is only charged by persons who carry on an enterprise ( that is vendors) on the taxable 
supplies made by them. Taxable supplies include supplies for which VAT is charged at either 
the standard rate or zero rate. See Chapters 2 and 6 for more details on registration and 
taxable supplies, respectively. 
1.2 How does VAT work? 
The South African VAT is destination based , which means that consumption of goods or 
services in South Africa is taxed. VAT is therefore paid on the supply of goods or services in 
South Africa as well as on the importation of goods  into South Africa. VAT is currently levied 
at the standard rate of 15%1F
5 on most supplies and importations, but there is a limited range of 
supplies of goods or services which are either exempt, or which are subject to tax at the zero 
rate (for example, exports are taxed at 0%  under certain circumstances). The importation of 
services is only subject to VAT where the services are imported for private, exempt or other 
non-taxable purposes. Certain imports of goods or services are exempt from VAT. 
See Chapters 6 and 12 for more details.  
1.3 Who charges VAT? 
Generally, vendors are required to charge VAT on all supplies of goods or services in South 
Africa, subject to certain exemptions and exceptions. A vendor is a person who is registered 
or is required to be registered for VAT.  See Chapter 2 for more details on registration as a 
vendor. 
 
4 See Director of Public Prosecutions, Western Cape v Parker  (103/2014) [2014] ZASCA 223; 2015 
(4) SA 28 (SCA). 
5  The standard rate of VAT changed from 14% to 15% with effect from 1 April 2018.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 1 
 
 2 
Vendors have to perform certain duties and take on certain responsibilities. For example, 
vendors must ensure that VAT is collected on taxable transactions, returns are submitted and 
payments made on time, tax invoices are issued where required and that all prices advertised 
or quoted include VAT. 
VAT is also payable on the importation of goods into South Africa, subject to certain 
exemptions and exceptions. The VAT on importation is payable by the importer, whether that 
person is a vendor or not. VAT is only payable on the importation of services b y any person 
where those services are acquired for non-taxable purposes. See Chapter 12 for more details 
on the importation of goods or services. 
Special VAT rules apply to the supply of valuable metals between registered vendors. 
The Domestic Reverse Charge Regulations relating to certain transactions involving gold and 
other valuable metals was published as Notice  2140 in GG  46512 dated 8  June 2022 (the 
DRC Regulations) with further amendments promulgated on 10  May 2024 as published in 
Government Gazette  50642. The DRC Regulations essentially provides that the recipient of 
the supply of valuable metal must account for the VAT on the supply instead of the supplier. 
See Error! Reference source not found. for more details on supplies under the DRC. 
1.4 Payment, recovery and refund of VAT 
The mechanics of the VAT system are based on a subtractive or credit input method which 
allows the vendor to deduct the tax incurred on enterprise inputs (input tax) and other 
permissible deductions from the tax collected on the supplies made by the vendor (output tax). 
This is known as the invoice-based credit method of the consumption -type VAT . 
See Chapter 8 for more details. 
The vendor reports to SARS at the end of every tax period on a VAT201 return , where the 
input tax incurred and other deductions are offset against the output tax collected for a specific 
tax period and the resulting net liability is paid to or net refund claimed from SARS (normally 
by no later than the 25 th day of the  first calendar month after the end of the tax period 
concerned). Vendors who are registered to submit their returns electronically have until the 
last business day of the said calendar month to submit their VAT201 together with the 
payment. See Chapters 3 and 10 for more details. 
Late payments of VAT attract a penalty of 10% of the outstanding tax. Interest is also charged 
at the prescribed rate on any late payments made after the month in which the payment for 
the tax period concerned was due as well as any balance of taxes outsta nding for past tax 
periods. The TA Act also imposes two types of pen alties, namely, administrative no n-
compliance penalties (Chapter 15 of the TA Act) and understatement penalties (Chapter 16 of 
the TA Act). See Chapter 11 for more details. 
It sometimes occurs that the result of the calculation for the tax period is a refund instead of 
an amount payable to SARS. This happens, for example, when a vendor incurs more VAT on 
expenses than the VAT due on any taxable supplies made during the tax period , or when a 
vendor has mainly zero-rated supplies (for example, an exporter, or a business  which sells 
only fresh fruit and vegetables ). However, most vendors will not nor mally be in a refund 
situation, and should be paying VAT to SARS at the end of each tax period. Refunds must be 
paid by SARS within 21 business days of receiving the correctly completed refund return , 
otherwise interest at the prescribed rate is payable by SARS to the vendor. However, interest 
is only paid if certain conditions are met  as a refund may be subject to the finalisation of the 
verification, inspection or audit of the refund. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 1 
 
 3 
The fact that there are often refunds under the VAT system and that it is self-assessed, makes 
it tempting for vendors to overstate input tax or to understate output tax. SARS therefore 
places great importance on identifying high risk cases, conducting regular compliance visits 
and promoting a high level of visibility of auditors in the field . See Chapters 10 and 16 for 
more details. 
Example 1 – Mechanism of the VAT system 
A VAT registered paper manufacturer sells 2 rolls of uncoated print paper sheets to a VAT 
registered stationery distributor for R92,00 (including VAT of R12,00). The paper manufacturer 
recycled waste paper for which it paid R 46,00 (including VAT of R 6,00) to a waste 
management company, to manufacture the paper rolls. The paper manufacturer must declare 
output tax of R12,00 (R92,00 × 15 / 115) for the 2 rolls of paper sold and may deduct the VAT 
incurred on purchase of the recycled waste paper as input tax (that is, R6,00).  
The stationery distributor also buys packaging boxes from another vendor for R 34,50 
(inclusive of R4,50 VAT). It cuts the paper rolls into A4 size sheets and packages them into 
20 boxes of 100 sheets per box of paper and sells them to a supermarket for R8,05 each. The 
selling price of each box of paper includes R1,05 VAT. The stationery distributor must 
therefore pay output tax of R1,05 on each box sold. The stationery distributor may deduct the 
VAT incurred on the purchase of the paper rolls and the packaging boxes as input tax (that is, 
R12.00 + R4,50 = R16,50).  
The supermarket sells 15 of the 20 boxes to its customers for R11,50 each (inclusive of R1,50 
VAT). The supermarket must declare output tax of R1,50 on each box of paper sold. The 
supermarket may deduct the VAT incurred on the purchase of the boxes of paper sheets as 
input tax ( that is, R21,00). Since the supermarket’s customers are the final consumers and 
are not registered for VAT, there is no input tax deducted by the customers on the R1,50 VAT 
charged. 
The effect in this example is illustrated in the diagram below.

1.5 Accounting for VAT 
As VAT is an invoice -based tax, vendors are generally required to account for VAT on the 
invoice (accrual) basis, but the payments (cash) basis is allowed in some cases. The 
payments basis of accounting is only available to specified qualifying vendors and is subject 
to prior approval being obtained  from SARS . Special rules also apply as to how certain 
supplies are accounted for, regardless of the accounting basis which the vendor uses to 
account for VAT. See Chapter 4 and 5 for more details. 
1.6 Documentation 
Tax invoices for supplies made, bills of entry for goods imported and the general maintenance 
of proper accounting records and documents are all very important aspects of how the VAT 
system operates. These documents  form an audit trail which SARS uses to verify that the 
vendor has complied with the law. A tax invoice , bill of entry or other prescribed 
documentation, and in some exceptional circumstances, a VAT ruling from SARS confirming 
that certain alternative documentation held by the vendor , may also serve as documentary 
evidence to substantiate an input tax deduction or any other deduction made by the vendor. 
See Chapters 8, 9, 13 and 16 for more details. 
1.7 Tax Administration Act 
The TA Act was promulgated into law on 4  July 2012 and commenced on 1 October 2012, 
except for those provisions relating to interest stipulated in the  Schedule to Proclamation 
No. 51 dated 14 September 2012 (as per GG 35687). 
With the implementation of the TA Act, certain administrative provisions previously contained 
in the VAT Act were replaced by similar provisions contained in the TA Act but where an 
administrative provision applies only to one tax type then the administrative provision is 
contained in the individual tax Act such as the VAT Act. A vendor must therefore adhere to 
the administrative requirements that are contained in the TA Act and the VAT Act.  
The TA Act covers a broad range of aspects , which will be mentioned briefly throughout the 
guide where it concerns the specific content dealt with in a particular chapter. Chapter 16 also 
deals with some of the more important aspects of the TA Act which generally apply to all taxes 
and which are not specifically dealt with in any other chapter of this guide. Some of the duties 
of a vendor that are impacted by the TA Act are registration, record-keeping, payments made 
to SARS and the obligation to inform SARS of changes in registered particulars to ensure that 
SARS has the most current information. These duties also apply to persons who have 
registered voluntarily as well as persons who should have registered for VAT, but who have 
not done so. 
The administrative provisions mentioned in this guide must therefore be understood within the 
context of the TA Act and any public notices under that Act with regard to a tax administration 
issue. 
See the Tax Administration webpage on the SARS website, where you can find more 
information on the TA Act, which includes, amongst others, the following documents:

Chapter 2  
Registering for VAT 
2.1 Enterprise 
A person can only register for VAT if that person is carrying on an enterprise. “Enterprise” is 
defined in section  1(1) to include any activity carried on continuously or regularly by any 
person in South Africa or partly in South Africa, resulting in income being earned from the 
supply of goods or services (that is supplied for a “consideration”) to another person, whether 
for profit or not. 
The following activities are specifically included in the definition of “ enterprise”, 
notwithstanding the general criteria for being an enterprise as discussed above: 
• Anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of an enterprise. 
• The supply of goods or services  by a public authority which the Minister is satisfied 
could be supplied by another person in carrying on a continuous business activity for 
purposes of earning income. In that case, the public authority is not considered to be 
carrying on an enterprise in  respect of those supplies until it is  notified by the 
Commissioner. 
• The activities of a “welfare organisation” for VAT purposes. 
• The activities of a share block company where such share bloc k company has been 
registered on a voluntary basis. 
• The activities of an implementing agency carried on in the course of implementing, 
operating, administering or managing a foreign donor funded project (FDFP). 
• The supply of certain electronic services by non-resident suppliers. 
The following are some situations that are not regarded as carrying on an enterprise  in the 
Republic: 
• If you only make exempt supplies (see Chapter 7 for examples). 
• If you are an e mployee earning a salary or wage from your employer (excluding an 
independent contractor).  Note that a non-executive director of a company is 
considered to be an independent contractor and not an employee.2F
6  
• When the supplies are made, for example, by a foreign branch located in another tax 
jurisdiction (subject to certain requirements).  
• Hobbies or any private recreational pursuits not conducted in the form of a business. 
• Private occasional transactions, for example, the sale of domestic/household goods, 
personal effects or a private motor vehicle. 
• Supplying “commercial accommodation” in circumstances where the total value of 
those supplies made or reasonably expected to be made does not exceed R120  000 
in any consecutive period of 12 months.3F

Executive Directors”,  Non-Executive Directors: FAQs on BGRs 40 and 41  and the VAT Quick 
Reference Guide for Non-Executive Directors for more information.

• A non-resident entity, not a registered vendor that takes ownership of goods in South 
Africa on a flash title basis and immediately on sells the goods to other non-resident 
customers that are also not registered vendors.  
• A non-resident lessor leasing foreign-owned ships, aircraft, rolling stock (for example, 
locomotives and carriages) or parts directly in connection thereto (for example, aircraft 
engines) for use in the Republic, to a lessee which is a resident of the Republic.  
Some specific examples of inclusions and exclusions are briefly discussed in 2.1.1 to 2.1.7 
below. 
2.1.1 Public authorities 
The term “public authority” is defined in section 1(1) to include – 
• all the national and provincial government departments listed in Schedules 1, 2 or 3 of 
the Public Service Act;4F
7 
• the entities (including subsidiaries and controlled entities thereof) listed in Parts A and 
C of Schedule 3 to the Public Finance Management Act5F
8 (PFMA); or 
• certain public entities which should be regarded as public authorities for VAT purposes. 
Public authorities exist to carry out the work of national and provincial government. The 
supplies made by public authorities are therefore not normally of the same type or nature 
found in the private sector, nor are they in competition with vendors in that sector. The supplies 
are therefore usually made in the context of carrying out a regulatory, administrative or 
stewardship function of government. 
In order for the supplies made by public authorities to be treated as “enterprise” activities, the 
public authority concerned has to be notified in that regard by the Commissioner, acting on 
instruction from the Mini ster. The Minister, in turn, has  to be satisfied that the supplies  
(or certain of them) are of the same kind or similar to taxable supplies already being made, or 
which might be made by vendors in the private sector .6F
9 Otherwise, the activities of public 
authorities are generally out-of-scope for VAT purposes and they will not  be able to register 
for VAT. See Interpretation Note 39 “VAT Treatment of Public Authorities and Grants” for more 
information. 
2.1.2 Activities of welfare organisations 
Special provision is made in the VAT Act to regard welfare organisations as enterprises to the 
extent that they make supplies in the course of carrying out specific welfare activities, even if 
they do not charge a consideration for making those supplies. 
To qualify as a welfare organisation for VAT purposes, the organisation must be an approved 
public benefit organisation (PBO) for income tax 7F
10 purposes and must also carry on one or 
more of the welfare activities as determined by the Minister 8F
11 for purposes of the VAT Act, 
under the following headings: 
• Welfare and humanitarian 
 
7 Act 103 of 1994. 
8 Act 1 of 1999. 
9 Paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “enterprise” in  section 1(1). 
10 For example, a PBO contemplated in s ection 30(1) of the Income Tax Act and approved by the 
Commissioner under section 30(3) of the said Act. 
11 See the regulations issued under GN 112 in GG 27235 of 11 February 2005 (the welfare activities 
regulations).

• Health care 
• Land and housing 
• Education and development 
• Conservation, environment and animal welfare 
See the VAT 414 – Guide for Associations not for Gain and Welfare Organisations , 
Interpretation Note 39  “VAT Treatment of Public Authorities and Grants” and Interpretation 
Note 70  “Supplies Made for No Consideration” for more details on the VAT treatment of 
welfare organisations. 
2.1.3 Share block companies 
A “share block company” is defined as a company whose activities comprise of or include the 
operation of any scheme in terms of which a share in that scheme grants a right to or an interest 
in the use of immovable property.9F
12 The shareholders of the share block company acquire rights 
to occupy specified parts of the immovable property allocated to their shares in the company. For 
VAT purposes, a share in a share block company is considered to be fixed property which falls 
within the ambit of “goods” as defined. The sale of shares in a share block company is therefore 
a supply of goods and a supply of fixed property for VAT purposes.F
13 
The definition of “enterprise” specifically includes the activities of any share block company 
(other than the exempt supply of services which are met out of levy contributions by 
membersF
14) where that company applied for voluntary registration as a vendor and was 
registered as such by the Commissioner. F
15 See the VAT 412 – Guide for Share Block 
Schemes for more details on the VAT treatment of share block companies. 
2.1.4 Foreign donor funded project 
A foreign donor funded project (FDFP) is a project established as a result of an international 
donor funding agreement to supply goods or services to beneficiaries, to which the South 
African government is a party. These international agreements are referred to as Official 
Development Assistance Agreements (OD AAs) and are binding on the Republic under 
section 231(3) of  the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa  (the Constitution ). The 
ODAAs normally provide that the funds donated should only be used for specific, mutually 
agreed upon programmes and activities, and cannot be used to pay for any taxes imposed 
under South African Law. 
The definition of “enterprise” was amended to include reference to the activities of an 
implementing agency in respect of the FDFP activities rather than to regard the FDFP as a 
separate person conducting the activities, as was the case before the amendment.16  
The definition “implementing agency” was also introduced. An implementing agency can 
include the government of the Republic, any institution or body established and appointed by 
a foreign government as contemplated in section 10(1)(bA)(ii) of the Income Tax Act to 
 
12 See the definition of “share block company” in section 1(1), read with the definition of “share block 
company” and “share block scheme” in section 1 of the Share Blocks Act 59 of 1980. 
13 The definition of “goods” under section 1(1) includes “fixed property” as defined and “fixed property” 
includes a share in a share block company. 
14 The services referred to in section 12(f)(ii). 
15 Paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “enterprise” in section 1(1). 
16  See amended paragraph (b)(v) of the definition of “enterprise” in section 1(1), which came into effect 
from 1 April 2020.

 8 
perform its functions in terms of the ODAA, or any person who has entered into a contract with 
either of these parties to implement, operate, administer or manage an FDFP. 
As a consequence of these amendments, an FDFP is no longer included in the definition of 
“person” whilst the new definition of an FDFP requires approval of that project by the Minister 
of Finance. 
To ensure that the implementing agency is separately identified relating to the activities of 
each FDFP, section 50(1) was amended to require the project to be registered as a separate 
entity from the main enterprise activities of the implementing agency. Section 50(2A) was 
introduced to require the  implementing agency to register its activities in respect of each 
foreign donor funded project as a separate branch.   
See the VAT Reference Guide for Foreign Donor Funded Projects for more information. 
2.1.5 Electronic services supplied by non-residents 
The definition of “enterprise” specifically includes the supply of certain electronic services by 
foreign e -commerce suppliers in respect of which at least any two of the following three 
circumstances apply: 
• The recipient of those electronic services is a South African resident.  
• Payment for such electronic services originates from a South African bank account.  
• The recipient of such electronic services has an address ( for example, residential, 
business or postal) in South Africa. 
The original Electronic Services Regulation ( ESR) came into effect on 1  June 2014, but the 
scope of services only covered a restricted list of electronic services. The list of electronic 
services is now set out in the updated ESR which came into effect on 1 April 2019.17 The main 
features of the new rules on electronic services can be summarised as follows: 
• The previous scope of “electronic services” under the original ESR was expanded to 
include any supplies of electronic services [subject to a few exceptions  such as 
telecommunications services,18 certain group company transactions and educational 
services, which are similar to those contemplated in the exemption under 
section 12(h)]. 
• The compulsory registration threshold for non-resident suppliers of electronic services 
was increased to R1 million (previously R50 000). Non-resident suppliers of electronic 
services can now also register voluntarily if they exceed the R50  000 threshold. An 
exception19 has been introduced to the effect that a foreign electronic services provider 
is not required to register as a vendor if the total value of taxable supplies of R1 million 
in any consecutive 12-month period has been exceeded solely as a consequence of 
abnormal circumstances of a temporary nature. 
• The definition of “enterprise” includes the activities of an “intermediary” if that person 
facilitates a supply of “electronic services” by a non-resident. “Facilitates” in this context 
means, for example, that the electronic services are advertised, sold or otherwise 
made available via an online marketplace or “platform” operated by the intermediary . 
 
17 See GN 429 in GG 42316 of 18 March 2019.  
18  The proposed amendment in the draft ESR dated 31 July 2020 includes a new definition for 
“telecommunications services” which provides a more detailed meaning.  
19  Proviso to section 23(1A) 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 9 
This rule applies in circumstances where the invoicing and collection of the payment 
for the supply is done by the intermediary.  
• A new provisionF
20 was introduced to deem an intermediary to be the supplier of 
electronic services in certain instances. The effect is that the intermediary facilitating 
supplies of electronic services will be liable to charge and account to SARS for the 
VAT on the supply of electronic services if t he non-resident principal is not registered 
for VAT in South Africa. An intermediary (whether resident or non -resident) will 
therefore be required to register and account for VAT if the value of their taxable 
supplies (including any deemed supplies) exceed s the new compulsory threshold of 
R1 million.  
• Previously, non-resident electronic services suppliers were automatically registered on 
the payments basis. From 21 August 2020, non-resident electronic services suppliers 
can opt to be registered on the invoice  basis. In addition, f rom 1 April 2021, 
intermediaries may apply to account for VAT on the payments basis. 
For more detailed information on the implications of the updated ESR  and consequential 
amendments, see the updated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Supplies of Electronic 
Services on the SARS website.  
2.1.6 Commercial accommodation 
Paragraph (a) of “commercial accommodation” as defined in section 1(1) includes lodging or 
board and lodging which is systematically supplied, together with domestic goods or services. 
However, a dwelling supplied in terms of an agreement for the letting and hiring thereof is 
specifically excluded from qualifying as the supply of “commercial accommodation”. The VAT 
Act defines a “dwelling” as any building, structure, premises or any other place which is mainly 
used as a residence  of a natural person. Typically, commercial accommodation 
establishments are those which supply short-term business and leisure type accommodation 
as their core business activity. 
The VAT Act defines “domestic goods or services” to include – 
• cleaning and maintenance 
• electricity, gas, air conditioning or heating 
• a telephone, television set, radio or other similar article 
• furniture and other fittings 
• meals 
• laundry 
• nursing services 
• water 
The total annual receipts from the activity of supplying commercial accommodation F
21 must 
exceed R120  00018F
22 or be reasonably expected to exceed that amount in a period of 
12 months, for the activity to be an enterprise.F
23  
 
20  Section 54(2B). 
21 Referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition. 
22 The threshold was increased from R60 000 to R120 000 with effect from 1 April 2017. 
23 Proviso (ix) to the definition of “enterprise” under section 1(1). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 10 
Lodging or board and lodging supplied in for example, a hospice or home for the aged, also 
constitutes “commercial accommodation”. The R120 000 threshold, however, does not apply 
to these kinds of commercial accommodation , but instead the normal R50  000 threshold for 
voluntary registration applies. 
See the VAT 411 – Guide for Entertainment, Accommodation and Catering  for more details 
on the VAT treatment of commercial accommodation. 
2.1.7 Cross border leasing of foreign-owned ships, aircraft and rolling stock  
In instances where foreign-owned ships, aircraft, rolling stock or parts directly in connection 
thereto are leased for use in the Republic, there was some uncertainty as to whether the 
foreign lessor is conducting an “enterprise” in the Republic. As a result, foreign lessors would 
often seek clarity from SARS by applying for a ruling. In order to address this issue, the VAT 
Act was amended by the insertion of proviso (xiii) to the definition of “enterprise”. The effect of 
this proviso is to clarify that from 1 April 2021, the supply by a non-resident of the right of use 
of ships, aircraft and rolling stock (for example, locomotives and carriages) in the specified 
circumstances will no longer be regarded as an “enterprise” conducted in the Republic by that 
person. From 1  April 2023, this proviso also includes the leasing of foreign -owned parts 
relating to such foreign-owned ships, aircraft or rolling stock if those parts are leased under a 
separate agreement and this proviso now applies.24 
This exclusion from the definition of “enterprise” will apply, even though the goods are supplied 
for use in the Republic, but it is subject to the following conditions: 
• The lessee (recipient) must be a resident of the Republic; 
• The lessor (supplier) must be a non -resident and must not be a registered vendor in 
the Republic; 
• The goods must be for use wholly or partly in the Republic; and 
• The contracting parties must agree in writing that the recipient will – 
➢ enter the goods for home consumption and be liable to pay the VAT on importation; 
and 
➢ not be reimbursed by the lessor for such VAT payable upon importation. 
As a result, if all of the above conditions are met, the foreign lessor will not be regarded as 
conducting an enterprise in the Republic and will not be liable to register for VAT. Refer also 
to VAT Connect – Issue 12 (June 2021) and VAT Connect – Issue 15 (December 2022) for 
more information in this regard, including reference to previous decisions issued under 
section 72 on such matters. 
2.2 When does a person become liable to register for VAT? 
The TA Act, together with the VAT Act regulates the identification and registration of vendors. 
The TA Act prescribes the general obligations that a person must comply with when registering 
for a tax, while the VAT Act sets out when a person is required to register. 
 
24  Since the wording of section 72 was amended with effect from 21  July 2019, any application for a 
decision to allow a non-resident lessor not to register in respect of any lease concluded in respect 
of the assets concerned before 1 April 2021 under section 72, cannot be considered. Proviso (ix) to 
the definition of “enterprise” in section 1(1) now provides the necessary certainty on the “enterprise” 
question from 1 April 2021. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 11 
You will be liable for compulsory VAT registration if you are carrying on an enterprise25 and 
make taxable supplies in the course or furtherance of that enterprise exceeding R1 million in 
any consecutive period of 12 months, or will exceed that amount in terms of a written 
contractual obligation. The R1 million compulsory VAT registration threshold 26 applies to the 
total value of taxable supplies (turnover) and not the net income (profit) that your business has 
made for the period. 
A person who is registered, or who is obliged to register, is referred to as a “vendor”. A person 
is referred to as a “vendor” from the date that person first became liable to register, subject to 
confirmation of such date by the Commissioner. In certain cases, t he Commissioner may 
determine that a person will be regarded as a vendor from a date which is later than the date 
that the person first became liable  to register, as may be considered equitable , after careful 
consideration of the circumstances of that person.F
27 
The term “person”28 includes the following: 
• Individuals 
• Partnerships and bodies of persons 
• Private and public companies, share block companies and close corporations (CCs) 
• Public authoritiesF
29 and municipalities 
• Associations not for gain such as clubs and welfare organisations 
• Insolvent and deceased estates 
• Trust funds 
You can still register voluntarily for VAT if your sales or fees (turnover) earned from making 
taxable supplies are less than R1 million and you meet certain conditions . This type of 
registration is referred to as a “voluntary registration”. See 2.3 for more details. 
2.2.1 Suppliers of “valuable metal” under the domestic reverse charges 
Vendors supplying “valuable metal” under the DRC vendor must re -validate its VAT 
registration with SARS within the earlier of 21  business days of the commencement date of 
the DRC Regulations (that is, within 21 business days of 1 July 2022) or the date that a supply 
subject to the domestic reverse charge are made. See Public Notice 2200 as published in 
GG 46598 dated 24 June 2022 for more details in this regard. Vendors that fail to comply with 
this requirement either wilfully or through neglect, will be guilty of an offence. 
 
25 See 2.1 for more details on enterprise. 
26  See 2.1.5. Before 1 April 2019, the compulsory registration threshold for non -resident suppliers of 
electronic services was R50 000 and not R1 million.  
27 Section 23(4)(b). 
28  Certain changes with regard to the administration of FDFPs came into effect from 1 April 2020, 
including that, from the said date, an FDFP is no longer regarded as a “person” as defined.  
29 Public authorities are generally not registered as vendors.

2.3 Voluntary registration 
2.3.1 General 
A person can apply for voluntary registration even though the total value of taxable supplies 
is less than R1 million. A person may apply for voluntary registration if that person – 
• is a “municipality” or is carrying on the activities of a “welfare organisation” or a “share 
block company”; or 
• is carrying on an enterprise and the value of taxable supplies made has exceeded the 
minimum threshold of R50 000 in the past 12 months;30 or 
• supplies commercial accommodation,31 provided the minimum threshold of R120 000 
is met  (see 2.1.5 for more details on enterprises supplying commercial 
accommodation); or 
• is carrying on an enterprise and the value of taxable supplies has not exceeded the 
R50 000 minimum threshold but can reasonably be expected to exceed that threshold 
within 12 months from the date of registration ( see Government Notice (GN) 447 in 
GG 38836 of 29 May 2015;32 or 
• is continuously and regularly carrying on one of the activities set out in GN 446 in 
GG 38836 of 29 May 2015, in respect of which it will only be possible to make taxable 
supplies after a period of time due to the nature of the business;F
33 or 
• intends to carry on an enterprise acquired as a going concern, provided that the value 
of taxable supplies made by the supplier of the going concern exceeded R50 000 in 
the past 12 months. 
The Commissioner will determine the effective date of registration once you have submitted 
your correctly completed registration application and have satisfied the requirements for 
voluntarily registration. It will generally not be advantageous for a person to register voluntarily 
where – 
• there are very few taxable expenses on which input tax can be deducted for example, 
when the main enterprise expense is salaries and wages; or 
• most of the supplies are made to final consumers who are not registered for VAT. 
Remember that if you choose to register, you will have to carry out all the duties of a vendor. 
For example, you will have to charge VAT, submit returns, make VAT payments on time and 
keep proper records for at least five years. I f you decide to register, remember that you can 
only charge VAT on taxable supplies. You may not charge VAT on supplies which are exempt 
from VAT or supplies which fall outside the scope of VAT. (These are supplies which are not 
in the course or furtheranc e of your “enterprise”). See Chapter 7 for more details and for 
examples of exempt supplies. 
The various circumstances under which a person may be allowed to register voluntarily are  
discussed in detail below.

33 See section 23(3)(d) and GN 446. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 13 
2.3.2 Municipalities 
The definition of the term “municipality” in the VAT Act refers to the definition as contained in 
section 1 of the Income Tax Act, which in turn, makes reference to section 12(1) of the Local 
Government: Municipal Structures Act.34 In effect, the term “municipality” means the category 
of mu nicipalities as contemplated in section  155 of the Constitution, which deals with the 
establishment of municipalities.  Municipalities have the right to administer certain local 
government activities in terms of the Constitution and are therefore involved in making many 
different types of supplies, for example, taxable, exempt and out-of-scope supplies.  
A municipality, as contemplated in the Constitution, may apply to register voluntarily for VAT, 
although in most cases, they will be compulsory registrations.  (See the VAT 419 – Guide for 
Municipalities for more details on the VAT treatment of municipalities). 
2.3.3 Welfare organisations 
A person may apply to register voluntarily if that person s atisfies the Commissioner that the 
person is carrying on the activities of a welfare organisation for VAT purposes. 
As discussed in 2.1.2, a welfare organisation that carries on one or more of the qualifying 
welfare activities for VAT purposes is regarded as an enterprise. The minimum threshold of 
R50 000 for voluntary registration is therefore not applicable to the welfare activities of a 
welfare organisation.35 This means that a welfare organisation is entitled to register for VAT 
purposes and to deduct VAT incurred on goods or services acquired in carrying out its welfare 
activities, even if it does not charge any consideration. A welfare organisation may also deduct 
input tax on entertainment expenses which are associated with its welfare activities. 
(Entertainment expenses are usually disallowed for other vendors.)36 
Normal VAT rules will apply to the extent of any ordinary business activities carried on by the 
welfare organisation, in respect of which goods or services are supplied for a consideration . 
Those activities will be carried on under the same VAT registration number as for the welfare 
activities. Should it be  specifically requested, separate VAT registration numbers may be 
issued for each of its separately identifiable branches, divisions or enterprises. 
See the VAT 414 – Guide for Associations not for Gain and Welfare Organisations, Interpretation 
Note 39 “VAT Treatment of Public Authorities and Grants” and Interpretation Note 70 “Supplies 
Made for No Consideration” for more details on the VAT treatment of welfare organisations. 
2.3.4 Share block companies 
See the VAT 412 – Guide for Share Block Schemes for more details on the VAT treatment of 
share block companies. 
2.3.5 Supply of a going concern 
You may apply for voluntary registration if you intend to carry on an enterprise from a future 
date if – 
• that enterprise or part thereof which is capable of separate operation will be supplied 
to you as a going concern (see 6.3.3 and Interpretation Note 57 “Sale of an Enterprise 
or Part Thereof as a Going Concern” for more details on the supply of an enterprise as 
a going concern); and

• the value of the taxable supplies made from carrying on that enterprise (or part thereof) 
by the supplier of the going concern has exceeded R50 000 in the preceding 12-month 
period. 
See VAT-REG-02-G01 – Guide for Completion of VAT Registration Application Forms – 
External Guide for supporting documents for the registration of an enterprise supplied as a 
going concern. 
2.3.6 Taxable supplies expected to exceed R50 000 
Under certain circumstances a person other than a “welfare organisation”, “municipality” or “share 
block company” carrying on an enterprise may apply to register voluntarily if th at 
person – 
• has made taxable supplies which do not exceed R50 000, or 
• has not made any taxable supplies as yet, 
and can satisfy the Commissioner that  the person can reasonably be expected to make 
taxable supplies in excess of R50 000 in the next 12 months period commencing from the date 
of registration.37 The Commissioner will be satisfied that a person will make taxable supplies 
in excess of the said R50 000 as expected, where one or more of the following circumstances 
set out in GN 447 exist: 
• If you have made taxable supplies for more than two months, and you have proof that 
the average value of taxable supplies in the preceding two months before date of 
application exceeded R4 200 per month.  
• If you only made taxable supplies for one month before the date of application, then 
the value of taxable supplies for that month must have exceeded R4 200.  
• You have a contractual obligation in writing to make taxable supplies in excess of 
R50 000 in the 12-month period following the date of registration. 
• If you have acquired finance from certain specified credit providers, to fund the 
expenditure incurred or to be incurred for your enterprise and your total repayments in 
the 12 months following the date of application will exceed R50 000.  
• You are able to provide proof of expenditure incurred or to be incurred or capital goods 
acquired in connection with the enterprise and  proof of payment o r an extended 
payment agreement as evidence that payment has already exceeded R50 000 or will 
exceed R50 000 within a 12-month period after the date of application. 
2.3.7 Taxable supplies made only after a certain period of time 
In certain cases a person may apply to register voluntarily if the Commissioner is satisfied that 
the nature of the business activity carried on by that person falls within one of the activities set 
out in GN 446, in respect of which it is only possible to make taxable supplies after a certain 
period of time.38 
The activities and requirements concerned can be summarised as follows: 
• Agriculture, farming, forestry and fisheries 
• Mining of minerals, metal, oil, gas or natural gas resources  (for example,  both 
exploration and extraction) 
 
37 Section 23(3)(b)(ii). 
38 Section 23(3)(d).

• The building of ships, yachts, other floating vessels and aircrafts 
• The manufacture or assembly of plant, machinery, motor vehicles and locomotives 
• The construction of residential or commercial buildings for the taxable supply thereof 
• Infrastructure development for purposes of carrying on an enterprise whereby the 
value of such development in terms of a contractual obligation exceeds R1 million and 
such development will take more than 12 months to complete 
• The treatment of mining products to improve the properties thereof ( that is 
beneficiation) 
You must ensure that you are in possession of the relevant permit, licence or similar document 
required to conduct any of the activities listed above from the relevant regulatory authority  (if 
required) when you apply for the voluntary registration. Alternatively, you must have proof that 
you have applied to the relevant authorities that are responsible for issuing the permit, licence 
or similar document. 
2.3.8 Turnover tax for micro businesses 
Turnover tax was initially introduced as a simplified tax system as an alternative to the current 
income tax and VAT systems. A qualifying micro business that is registered for turnover tax 
may also choose to register for VAT provided that all the conditions for voluntarily registration 
are met. For more information, see the Tax Guide for Micro Businesses. 
2.3.9 Refusal of a voluntary registration application 
The Commissioner must be satisfied that the person applying for voluntary registration meets the 
following requirements: 
• Has a fixed place of residence or business 
• Keeps proper accounting records 
• Has opened a banking account in the RSA 
• Has not previously been registered as a vendor under VAT or General Sales Tax (GST) 
and failed to perform the duties of a vendor 
In the event that any of the above requirements are not met, the Commissioner may refuse 
the registration.39 
2.4 How must the value of taxable supplies be calculated? 
The value of taxable supplies (turnover) made in carrying on all your enterprises is taken into 
account to determine whether you are liable to register. A  person who operates several 
enterprises, or who operates an enterprise in branches or divisions cannot avoid the liability 
to register for VAT by considering the turnover of each enterprise, branch or division 
individually, subject to certain exceptions  (See 2.7 for more details on the exceptions) . 
Therefore, at the time of closing off your books for the month, you need to keep a running total 
of the turnover in respect of all your enterprises for the past 12 months. Should this running 
total exceed R1 million in any particular month, you become liable to register from the first day 
of the next month.40 
 
39 Section 23(7). 
40 Section 23(1)(a). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 16 
You also need to consider the next 12  months, because if you have a contractual obligation 
in writing to make taxable supplies in excess of R1 million within a 12-month period, you will 
be liable to register at the commencement of the first month in which the said 12-month period 
begins.41 You must apply for registration within 21  business days of becoming liable to 
register.42 The same rule s apply for a non-resident suppl ier of electronic services to 
South African residents. However, if that supplier of electronic services also facilitates the 
supplies of any other non -resident supplier of electronic services as “intermediary” on a 
platform, then the value of those facilitated supplies also counts towards the calculation of the 
R1 million compulsory VAT registration threshold. This rule only applies  when those other 
suppliers are not registered for VAT in South Africa at the time of supply. 
Example 2 – Calculating the total value of taxable supplies for registration purposes 
Facts: 
Z trades as ABC Construction  and tenders for a building contract of R5  million. The fees 
earned from construction activities were, on average, R120 000 per month for each of the past 
12 months. 
Result: 
If ABC Construction is not awarded the contract, Z has an option to register voluntarily, or elect 
not to register. However, if awarded the contract, Z would immediately know that the R1 million 
compulsory VAT registration threshold  is going to be exceeded . In this case, Z would be 
required to register within 21 business days, calculated from the first day of the month in which 
the value of taxable supplies will exceed R1  million in a 12 -month period commencing from 
that month.  
The table below gives a general indication of what to include and exclude when calculating 
the value of taxable supplies, to determine if you are liable for VAT registration. 
Include Exclude 
• Sales/fees earned from goods or services  
supplied in the RSA 
• Sales from stock or capital assets when 
closing down your business or substantially 
reducing (permanently) the scale of your 
business  
• Sale of goods exported to an export country • Sales from old plant, machinery or other 
capital assets when replacing them with new 
assets 
• Services rendered outside the RSA • Any exempt supplies 
• Sales from all branches and divisions falling 
under that person inside the RSA 
• Donations received by associations not for 
gain 
• Deemed supplies (see Chapter 6) • VAT 
 
41 Section 23(1)(b). 
42 Section 22 of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2

2.5 Where must a person register? 
The application for registration must be made through one of the following channels: 
• eFiling; or 
• at a SARS branch, via virtual, audio or walk in appointment made via the 
SARS website.  
Alternatively, an authorised registered tax practitioner may make the application on behalf of 
the applicant. (In such cases, the application must be accompanied by the power of attorney.) 
A vendor that has several enterprises/branches/divisions which will operate under one VAT 
registration number should register in the area where the main enterprise/branch/division is 
located. 
If you are a non-resident supplier of electronic services you must complete form VAT 101 and 
send it by email to eCommerceRegistration@sars.gov.za together with the supporting 
documents (see VAT-REG-02-G02 – VAT Registration Guide for Foreign Suppliers of 
Electronic Services). Once you have successfully registered then you must register as an 
eFiler, which will enable you to file returns electronically and make VAT payments from outside 
South Africa. 
2.6 What documents must be submitted with an application? 
It is very important that y ou submit the correct documents with your application to register; 
otherwise there may be a delay in obtaining your VAT registration number . See  
the VAT-REG-02-G01 – Guide for Completion of VAT Registration Application Forms  – 
External Guide  and VAT-REG-02-G02 – VAT Registration Guide for Foreign Suppliers of 
Electronic Services for a comprehensive list of documents that must be submitted. 
SARS will not accept any faxed or photocopied applications for registration. The requirement 
for a “recent” document refers to a document that is not more than three months old from the 
date of application for registration. All interactions with SARS in this regard , including the 
submission of documents, should be done on the eFiling platform or via specific channels or 
email addresses provided for that purpose on the SARS website. 
Once you have been registered, you will receive a Notice of Registration . The Notice of 
Registration can be requested and obtained on e -Filing by registered e-Filers. You can also 
confirm if your registration has been processed by entering your details under “VAT vendor 
search” on the SARS website. [Go to  www.sars.gov.za  eFiling  select “VAT Vendor 
Search” in the drop-down box on the left hand side of the screen.] 
Allow at least 21 business days for your application to be processed. Where no risk is identified 
SARS will issue the VAT number immediately. The Notice of Registration is issued to you on 
eFiling if you are a registered eFiler or it will be sent to your email address, or posted to the 
postal address given on your registration application. Should you need a copy of the Notice of 
Registration, you can call the SARS National Service Centre. 
2.7 Separate activities 
As discussed in  2.4, the liability to register is determined by considering all the enterprises 
carried on by a  person, irrespective of whether the enterprises are carried on in separate 
branches, divisions or enterprises  operated by that person . The Commissioner registers all 
the enterprises of a person under a single VAT registration number. Under certain 
circumstances, the separate branches or divisions or enterprises of a person may, however, 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 18 
be registered under separate VAT registration numbers or treated as separate persons. The 
particular circumstances are discussed below. 
2.7.1 Branches, divisions and separate enterprises 
A vendor may register separately any branches , divisions or enterprises carried on for VAT 
purposes.F
43 This means that it is possible for a vendor to have more than one VAT registration 
number if the enterprise is carried on in branches or divisions. A separate form VAT102e must 
be completed for each enterprise/division/branch for which a separate registration is required. 
There are two conditions under which separate registration can be granted for any separate 
enterprise, division or branch, namely – 
• an independent system of accounting for each business must be maintained; and 
• the entity must be capable of being separately identified ( that is, either by the nature 
of the activities or the geographic location). 
The implication of separate registration is that each separately registered 
enterprise/division/branch is treated as a vendor in its own right.44 
Each enterprise/division/branch will therefore be required to – 
• retain the same tax period as the main branch (except farmers in certain cases); 
• submit separate returns and payments; 
• retain the same accounting basis as the parent vendor and keep its own accounting 
records; and 
• remain registered until cancelled by the parent body or until the parent body’s 
registration is cancelled. 
In addition, any transfers of taxable goods or services between the separately registered 
enterprises, divisions or branches must be charged with VAT and accounted for on the 
relevant VAT201 return covering that period. 
Example 3 – Separate registrations and the liability to register 
Facts: 
N is a sole proprietor and trades under the following three trading names: 
N’s Curry Den  G’s Florists    B’s Shoe Retailers 
Turnover of R510 000  Turnover of R390 000   Turnover of R220 000 
Result: 
The combined tu rnover of the three businesses is R1 120 000. Since the type of supplies 
being made are not exempt ( see Chapter 7 for examples of exempt supplies), they will 
constitute “taxable supplies”.  
 
43 Section 50(1). 
44  However, see Wenco International Mining Systems Ltd and Another v CSARS (59922-2019) [2021] 
ZAGPPHC 70 (19 January 2021). This case dealt with the question of whether a non -resident 
person was carrying on an enterprise in the Republic or whether that activity was conducted by a 
separate “branch” in South Africa for VAT regist ration purposes. In the circumstances of this 
particular case, the non -resident person (a Canadian company) was found to be liable for VAT 
registration in regard to the supplies that it made in the Republic, rather than any separate “branch”. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 19 
 
The “person” carrying on all three businesses is N, a sole proprietor. Therefore, the combined 
turnover of all the three business is considered in determining whether N is liable to register. 
Since N is liable for VAT registration, that is, the combined turnover exceeds R1 million, N is 
referred to as a “vendor”  and must account for VAT at the standard rate on all the sales in 
each business from the date of liability to register as a vendor.  
N will only be issued with one VAT registration number, but can apply for three separate VAT 
numbers if the conditions for separate registration  are met . If SARS agrees to allocate 
separate VAT registration numbers, each separate business is deemed to be a separate 
person and VAT must be charged on supplies between the separate businesses, as well as 
to any other person. 
2.7.2 Association not for gain 
An association not for gain which carries on its enterprise in branches or divisions, or carries 
on separate enterprises, may apply in writing for any of those branches, divisions or 
enterprises to be regarded as separate persons, and to register separately for VAT.45  
Application for the registration of separate activities must be made in writing to SARS, and 
will only be allowed where the separate branch, division or enterprise – 
• maintains an independent accounting system; and 
• can be separately identified by the nature of its activities or its geographic location. 
The practical implication is that an association not for gain can separately apply the 
compulsory and voluntary registration threshold s to each of its branches, divisions or 
enterprises in order to determine which of them must, or could be registered. The association 
not for gain could therefore end up registering and accounting for VAT only in respect of certain 
specific taxable activities, instead of all activities. (See the VAT 414 – Guide for Associations 
not for Gain and Welfare Organisations for more information in this regard.) 
2.8 Application by persons not yet awarded a tender  
If any person who is not already registered for VAT, intends submitting a tender for project 
work (whether it be in the private or public sector), that person will not be registered as a 
vendor in anticipation of being awarded the contract. Only once the tender outcome is final 
and the contract awarded to that person, will SARS consider an application for registration as 
a vendor. This will also be subject to the normal VAT registration requirements as set out 
earlier in this chapter being met. 
The State Tender Board (Office of the Chief Procurement Officer) has been informed that the 
applications for VAT registration by persons who have not as yet been awarded a tender, will 
be denied due to the fact that the relevant provisions of the VAT Act would not yet have been 
met.  
If a person has incorrectly been registered in anticipation of being awarded a tender and the 
tender is not awarded, the person would have to de-register. The registration therefore places 
an unnecessary administrative burden on SARS and the person concerned. 
 
45 Section 23(5). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 20 
2.9 Cancellation of registration 
A vendor may apply for cancellation of registration if the value of taxable supplies is less than 
the compulsory registration threshold of R1 million in any consecutive period of 12 months.46 
The Commissioner will also deregister a vendor if – 
• the enterprise closes down and will not commence again within the next 12 months; or 
• the enterprise never actually commenced or will not commence within the next 
12 months; or 
• no longer complies with the requirements for voluntary registration. 
The SARS office where you are registered  should be informed promptly  in writing of your 
situation whether you want to voluntarily deregister, your circumstances have changed so that 
you are no longer liable, or you are no longer eligible to be registered as a vendor.  
Cancellation of registration normally takes effect from the last day of the tax period in which a 
vendor ceases trading. However, in the case of a voluntary deregistration, the Commissioner 
will decide the date of deregistration and the final tax period. In that regard, you must continue 
to charge and declare VAT on supplies made and make input tax and/or other deductions that 
you are entitled to, up to the last day of the final tax period as advised by SARS. 
The Commissioner may also decide to deregister a person who has successfully applied for 
voluntary registration and it subsequently appears that any of the  specific circumstances 
mentioned under 2.3.9, in respect of which the Commissioner may refuse to allow a person to 
voluntarily register, are applicable to that person.47 From 1 April 2014, the Commissioner has 
the discretion to deregister any vendor that fails to furnish a VAT return in respect of a tax 
period.48 
Any of a vendor’s separately registered enterprises/divisions/branches may also be 
cancelled49 if – 
• the vendor applies in writing; 
• the main registration is cancelled (in which case, all of the branch registrations will be 
cancelled); or 
• it appears to the Commissioner that the duties under the VAT Act or the TA Act have 
not been carried out properly. 
The effect of the cancellation of a branch registration is that all duties revert to the main branch. 
See 6.2.1 and BGR 17 “Cancellation of Registration of Separate Enterprises, Branches and 
Divisions” for more information in this regard. 
With effect from 1  April 2019, the compulsory registration threshold for foreign electronic 
services suppliers was increased from R50  000 to R1 million. These suppliers may apply to 
cancel their VAT registration if the value of electronic services supplied to South African 
recipients did not exceed R1 million the preceding 12-month period.50  
 
46 Section 24(1) and (2). 
47 Section 24(6). 
48 See section 24(5)(b). 
49 See section 50(3) and (4). 
50  Section 23(1A). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 2 
 
 21 
A vendor that has no intention to continue as a voluntary VAT registrant may apply to be 
deregistered on the basis that the value of taxable supplies is less than R1  million in a 12 -
month period. A person, being a microbusiness (see 2.3.8) with a turnover equal to or less 
than R1 million, may elect to remain registered for VAT and t here is no longer an automatic 
deregistration from the VAT register. See the SARS website for more information. 
Remember though, that SARS cannot completely deregister you until all outstanding liabilities 
or obligations incurred under the VAT  Act have been settled or resolved. For example, you 
cannot be taken off the VAT register if you still owe SARS returns for past tax periods or if any 
VAT payments are outstanding. 
2.10 Diesel refund scheme 
Should you consume diesel in carrying on an enterprise that performs own primary production 
activities in farming, forestry,  mining or fishing, or certain other activities such as coastal 
shipping, you can also register for the Diesel Refund Scheme which is currently administered 
through the VAT system. VAT registration is a pre-requisite for participation in the scheme. A 
qualifying diesel refund user may register for the scheme at the local SARS office by 
completing form VAT101D. 
Note that refunds under the Diesel Refund Scheme are merely processed by utilising the VAT 
administrative system. The concession is actually granted in respect of the general fuel levy 
and / or Road Accident Fund levy paid on eligible purchases of diesel used in  qualifying 
activities under the Customs and Excise Act. The diesel refunds are therefore offset against 
any VAT which may be payable for the tax period concerned, or alternatively, will increase 
any VAT refund if the input tax for the period exceeds the output tax liability. 
It is important that all the relevant documentation is kept relating to diesel purchases, storage 
and usage, including the required storage logbooks and usage logbooks that substantiate the 
actual volumes of diesel stocks and its application  for qualifying or non -qualifying activities 
during the tax period. Remember that a refund of the general fuel levy and / or Road Accident 
Fund levy included in the price of the diesel can only be claimed as a deduction against the 
output tax due on the VAT201 return to the extent that the diesel is actually used during the 
tax period for qualifying purposes. 
Any diesel refund which is found to be incorrectly deducted and paid would have to be paid 
back to SARS, together with any interest and any other amount that may be levied as a result 
of that non-compliance. It is therefore important to make sure that you actually qualify for the 
Diesel Refund Scheme before registering and that the eligible purchases of diesel were in fact 
used for qualifying purposes before making a diesel refund claim on your VAT return. 
For more guidance on Diesel Refunds see section 75 and Note 6 to Part 3 of Schedule No. 6 
to the Customs and Excise Act which is available on the SARS website.

Chapter 3  
Tax periods 
3.1 Which tax periods are available? 
You are required to submit returns and account for VAT to SARS according to the tax period 
allocated to you. Available tax periods cover one, two, six or twelve calendar months. On 
acceptance of your registration by SARS, you will generally be allocated one of these 
categories. Tax periods end on the last day of a calendar month. You may, however, apply to 
the SARS branch office in writing for your tax period to end on another fixed day or date, which 
is limited to 10  days before or after the end of the month (the 10 -day rule). This must be 
approved in writing and can only be changed with the written approval of SARS. See 3.3 and 
BGR 19 “Approval to End a Tax Period on a Day Other Than the End of the Month” for more 
details on tax period cut-off dates. 
3.1.1 Two-monthly tax period (Category A or B) 
This is the standard tax period, which is generally allocated at the time of registration. Under 
this category you are required to submit one return for every two calendar months. 
• Category A is a two-month period ending on the last day of January, March, May, July, 
September and November.  
• Category B is a two -month period ending on the last day of February, April, June, 
August, October and December. 
3.1.2 Monthly tax period (Category C) 
Under this category you are required to submit one return for each calendar month. You will 
be registered according to Category C when – 
• your turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed R30  million in any consecutive period of 
12 months. (Remember that if a person operates more than one business, or a 
business with different divisions, branches or separate enterprise activities , the sales 
of all the separate components of the enterprise must be added together to determine 
the total turnover. This applies, whether or not permission has been granted to have 
separate VAT registration numbers for each component of the enterprise);  
• you have applied in writing for this category; or 
• you have repeatedly failed to perform any obligations as a vendor. 
You will cease to be registered under Category C if you apply in writing to be allocated to a 
different tax period and SARS is satisfied that you meet the requirements of the relevant 
category. Should your turnover exceed R30  million in any consecutive period of 12  months 
subsequent to your registration for VAT, you are required to notify SARS to amend your 
registration to a Category C tax period within 21  days of becoming liable to register for a 
Category C tax period. Where SARS detects an increase in turnover to an amount exceeding 
R30 million, SARS  will change the registration to C ategory C and inform the vendor 
accordingly. 
Failure to notify SARS may result in interest and penalties being levied.  All vendors falling 
within Category C tax period must submit their returns in electronic format and make payments 
electronically on eFiling. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 3 
 
 23 
3.1.3 Six-monthly tax period (Category D) 
Under this category you are required to submit one return for every six calendar months. This 
is a category for vendors – 
• who are micro business es under the Income Tax Act  and have  made a written 
application to be placed under Category D; or 
• who solely carry on a farming, pastoral or agricultural  enterprise and whose  total 
turnover has not exceeded R1,5 million per consecutive period of 12 months and is not 
likely to exceed that amount in the next consecutive 12 months; or 
• who solely carry on a farming, pastoral or agricultural enterprise as a  separate 
enterprise, branch or division of a vendor  or an  association not for gain  as 
contemplated in 2.7.2 and whose total turnover has not exceeded R1,5  million in the 
past 12 months and is not likely to exceed that amount in the next 12  months. This 
category is only available to the specific separate enterprise, branch or division  of a 
person that carries on a farming, pastoral or agricultural enterprise and does not apply 
to all taxable activities of that person. 
If you have been allocated this category it means that you are required to submit your returns 
every six-months, usually ending on the last day of February and August. You may, however, 
apply to the local SARS office to alter the end of the period to another month. 
3.1.4 Annual tax period (Category E) 
Under this category you are required to submit one return every 12 calendar months. This 
category is for vendors who want their tax periods to align with their “year of assessment” as 
defined in section 1(1) of the Income Tax Act. The vendor must submit a written application in 
the prescribed form for registration under this category and must comply with the following: 
• The vendor must be a company or a trust fund. 
• The supplies by the vendor applying for Category E must be made to a connected 
person in relation to that vendor and consist solely of – 
➢ the letting of fixed properties; or  
➢ the renting of movable goods; or 
➢ the administration or management of such companies. 
• The connected person who receives the supply must be registered for VAT and must 
be entitled to deduct the full amount of input tax in respect of those supplies. 
• The vendor must agree with the recipients that tax invoices are issued only once a 
year at the end of the year of assessment of the vendor making the supplies. 
3.2 Allocation and change of tax periods 
3.2.1 New registrations  
The Commissioner will determine whether the vendor falls within Category A or Category B , 
should the vendor not fall within Category C, D or E. If a tax period other than Categories A or 
B is required, the vendor needs to meet the requirements for that tax period and apply for it. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 3 
 
 24 
3.2.2 Change of circumstances after registration 
A request for a change of category can only be done at a SARS branch office, implemented 
with effect from a future date, and cannot be backdated, except in the following instances: 
• If the wrong category has been captured in the registration process  (the vendor is 
required to submit proof that SARS made an error); or 
• If the circumstances of the vendor have changed such that it is required for that vendor 
to be registered within another category. (For example, if the taxable supplies exceed 
R30 million in any consecutive period of 12 months, Category C is applicable). 
A vendor that is not registered under Category C is required to inform SARS when the turnover 
exceeds or is likely to exceed R30 million in any consecutive period of 12 months. Similarly, a 
vendor that has been registered under Category D must inform SARS that the conditions of 
the tax period concerned are no longer met when the total value of the taxable supplies for 
the past 12 months has exceeded R1,5 million or is likely to exceed R1,5 mil lion in the next 
12 months. 
The tax period will also be changed automatically by SARS to Category A or B (as appropriate 
in the relevant case) if the vendor concerned fails to inform SARS that the total value of the 
taxable supplies no longer meets the requirements for the tax period concerned . The tax 
period is also changed automatically by SARS to a Category C if the total value of taxable 
supplies has exceeded R30 million in any consecutive period of 12 months. 
3.3 The 10-day rule 
A vendor that has an accounting date within 10  days before or after the end of the month in 
which the tax period ends, may use that date as the last day for the tax period. A vendor who 
wishes to apply this option must select a fixed day or date approved by the Commissioner . 
The day or date can be before or after the end of the tax period but it must be used consistently 
for a minimum period of 12 months.51 
For example, a vendor may select the 27th day of a month (fixed date), or the last Friday in the 
month (fixed day but not a fixed date). The election by the vendor to use a cut-off date allowed 
under the 10-day rule does not affect the due date for submitting the return , which remains 
the 25th day (or the last business day in the case of eFiling users)52 after the end of the month 
covered by that tax period). 
SARS has approved the following categories53 of fixed cut-off dates subject to the 10-day 
rule: 
• A specific day of the week 
• A specific date of a calendar month 
• A fixed day determined in accordance and consistent with the vendor’s commercial 
accounting periods 
 
51 The “first day” of a tax period means the first day following the last day of the vendor’s preceding 
tax period but can also be a fixed day as approved by the Commissioner under the 10-day rule. 
52 See 10.3 for more information. 
53  See BGR 19 “Approval to End a Tax Period on a Day other than the Last Day of a Month” for more 
details.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 3 
 
 25 
In any other case, if the preferred cut-off dates do not fall within one of the categories listed in 
BGR 19, the vendor concerned may apply for a VAT ruling or VAT class ruling to determine 
another appropriate date on which the tax period(s) should end.54  
 
  
 
54  See Chapter 15 for more details on how to apply for a VAT ruling.

Chapter 4  
Accounting basis 
4.1 Introduction 
The South African VAT system generally requires vendors to account for VAT on the basis of 
invoices being issued or received. This method of accounting is referred to as the “invoice 
basis” or “accrual basis” . However, certain vendors may qualify to use a different method 
referred to as the “payments basis” or “cash basis” of accounting. The  differences between 
these two methods, as well as the requirements of each are discussed below. 
4.2 Invoice basis 
Under this method of accounting vendors must  generally account for the full amount of VAT 
included in the price of the goods or services supplied in the tax period in which the time of 
supply has occurred. This applies to the output tax liability on cash and credit sales as well as 
the input tax that may be deducted on cash and credit purchases.55 
According to the general time of supply rule, a supply occurs at the earlier of the following 
events: 
• At the time that an invoice is issued; or 
• At the time any payment is received by the supplier. 
Vendors must therefore account for the full amount of output tax on any supplies made in the 
tax period, even where payment has not yet been received from the recipient. Similarly, the 
full amount of input tax may be deducted on supplies received in the ta x period, even where 
payment has not yet been made.  In order to substantiate the deduction, t he vendor must be 
in possession of  prescribed documentation – see Chapter 8. Furthermore, the vendor also 
needs to consider if the input tax on any particular supply is specifically denied before making 
a deduction. 
Section 9 also contains special time of supply rules . The special time of supply rule s take 
precedence over the general time of supply rule for purposes of accounting for output tax . 
Examples include, amongst others, rental agreements, fixed property, coin operated vending 
machines. See Chapter 5 for more details. 
All vendors must account for VAT on the invoice (or accrual) basis unless application has been 
made and permission has been received from the Commissioner to use the payments basis 
of accounting. (Note however that fixed property transactions are accounted for to the extent 
of payment made towards the purchase price irrespective of whether a vendor is on the invoice 
or payments basis – see 4.5.2). 
 
55 Note that the input tax deduction is subject to the documentation requirements under section 16(2). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 4

Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the invoice basis of accounting are set out in 
the table below: 
Advantages Disadvantages 
• Deduct VAT incurred on purchases before 
payment. 
• Fewer adjustments required when reconciling 
for income tax purposes. 
• Easy to calculate and implement accounting 
systems (based on invoices issued/received 
for sales and purchases). 
• Account for VAT on sales before receiving 
payment from debtors. 
• Can lead to cash flow difficulties when vendor 
allows extended payment terms. 
4.3 Payments basis 
Under t he payments basis (or cash basis) the vendor only accounts for VAT on actual 
payments made and actual payments received in respect of taxable supplies during the period. 
The payments basis is intended to help certain types of  businesses. (Note however th ose 
instances as discussed in 4.5.1 and 4.5.3 where the vendor is treated as being registered on 
the invoice basis). 
The effect of the payments basis of accounting is that the date to account for VAT is delayed 
until payment has been made . This does not mean that the time of supply rules set out in 
section 9 are deferred. A vendor that accounts for VAT on the payments basis of accounting 
is still required to issue a tax invoice within 21 days of making a taxable supply to the recipient, 
but is only required to account for and pay any output tax due to SARS to the extent that 
payment has been received from the recipient. Similarly, any VAT charged to a vendor on 
goods or services acquired for taxable purposes will only be deductible to the extent that 
payment has been made by the vendor in respect of the taxable supply. 
A vendor must apply in writing to SARS before being allowed to apply the payments basis . 
A person may be allowed to account on the payments basis from the date of registration. 
However, if the person previously accounted for VAT on the invoice basis, that person will only 
be allowed to account on the payments basis from a future tax period as specified by the 
Commissioner.  
The payments basis is only available to: 
• Vendors who are natural persons (or partnerships consisting only of natural persons) 
whose total taxable supplies at the end of a tax period have not exceeded R2,5 million 
in the previous 12 months, and are not likely to exceed R2 ,5 million in the next 12 
months. 
• Public authorities, water boards, certain municipal entities, municipalities, associations 
not for gain and welfare organisations – regardless of the value of taxable supplies. 
• Vendors who are non-resident suppliers of certain electronic services or intermediaries 
through which such supplies are made.56 (See 2.1.5 for more details in this regard). 
 
56  See amended section 15(2)(a)(vii). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 4 
 
 28 
• Certain v endors that have been allowed to register voluntarily in accordance with 
section 23(3)(b)(ii) must account for VAT on the payment s basis until the R50  000 
threshold is met.F
57 
• The South African Broadcasting Corporation as contemplated in section  8A of the 
Broadcasting Act 4 of 1999.58 
Juristic persons (for example, companies) and trust funds  do not qualify for the payments 
basis unless they are the type of entity included in any of those listed above. 
A few advantages and disadvantages of the payments basis of accounting are set out in the 
table below. 
Advantages Disadvantages 
• Suitable for small businesses.  
• Advantageous when the vendor allows lengthy 
periods of credit. 
• Facilitates cash flow. 
• May deduct VAT only after payments made to 
suppliers. 
• More difficult to implement accounting systems 
to manage, administer and calculate 
accurately (for example, reconciliation with 
income tax returns and adjustments). 
 
Example 4 – Comparison of invoice basis vs payments basis of accounting 
Assume the following sales and purchases figures (including VAT) for the tax period January 
to February 2023. Input tax and output tax is calculated by applying the applicable tax fraction 
(15/115) to the relevant amounts – that is, amounts invoiced (invoice basis) and cash amounts 
(payments basis).  
 Invoice basis Payments basis 
Output tax R R 
Total sales R46 000 (cash received R11 500) 6 000 1 500 
Input tax 
Total purchases R23 000 (paid full amount in cash) 3 000 3 000 
VAT payable / (refundable)  3 000 (1 500) 
On the payment s basis, output tax on sales is declared to the extent payment has been 
received and input tax on purchases deducted to the extent payment towards the purchase 
price has been made . Output tax of R1  500 would be declared and input tax of R 3 000 
deducted in the Jan-Feb 2023 VAT201 return. 
 
57 These vendors are automatically registered on the payments basis without having to apply to SARS 
for a directive [Section 15(2B) read with section 23(3)(b)(ii)].  
58 With effect from 1 April 2016. See section 15(2)(a)(viii). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 4 
 
 29 
4.4 Change of accounting basis 
A change of accounting basis may occur where the vendor applies to SARS and receives 
permission to adopt a more suitable system for the type of business concerned (provided the 
requirements are met). This could involve a change from the invoice to the payments basis, 
or vice versa, depending on the advantages and disadvantages for that particular business . 
A vendor may, in certain instances, elect to change the accounting basis by accessing the 
RAV form on efiling.59 
A vendor that is registered on the payments basis  may, at any time, submit a written 
application to SARS to use the invoice basis. SARS may also require a vendor to change from 
the payments basis to the invoice basis if that vendor ceases to qualify for the payments basis. 
For example: 
• A vendor who is a natural person (or partnerships consisting only of natural persons)  
may have achieved business growth ove r time and managed to exceed R2 ,5 million 
threshold prescribed in the VAT Act. Such vendors cease to qualify for the payments 
basis at the end of the tax period in which the value of taxable supplies in a ny 
consecutive period of 12 months exceeded R2,5 million or if that threshold is likely to 
be exceeded in the next 12 months. (However, should the increase in turnover be 
solely as a result of enterprise assets being sold because of a permanent reduction in 
the size of the business or due to the replacement of capital assets or abnormal 
circumstances of a temporary nature, the payments basis may be retained).  
• A vendor who is an individual may decide to conduct the business activities under a 
different legal entity such as a company , and so, be disqualified from utilising the 
payments basis of accounting . (This will also require a new registration to be 
processed and a new VAT registration number to be issued). 
• A vendor that was allowed to register for VAT voluntarily under section 23(3)(b)(ii) 
without making taxable supplies of R50 000 must migrate to the invoice basis once the 
R50 000 threshold is reached. The vendor may, however, r emain on the payments 
basis provided that it falls within one of the entities who qualify to be on the payments 
even after reaching the threshold.60 
A vendor that is registered on the payments basis (other than a vendor that is obliged to use 
such basis due to voluntary registration under section 23(3)(b)(ii)) – 
• is required to notify SARS in writing within a prescribed period of 21 days of ceasing 
to qualify for the payments basis; and 
• must change to the invoice basis from the commencement of a future tax period as 
determined by the Commissioner where the vendor has applied in writing for such 
change or has notified SARS within the prescribed period of 21 days that it has ceased 
to qualify for the payments basis. The Commissioner may determine that the invoice 
basis should be used from any tax period, including a past tax period, where SARS is 
satisfied that the vendor has ceased to qualify for the payments basis and such vendor 
failed to notify SARS within the prescribed 21 days. (See 4.3 for qualifying vendors).  
 
59  SARS may also notify a vendor to change accounting basis from the payments basis to the invoice 
basis if the requirements for the payments basis are no longer met. 
60 Section 15(2B). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 4 
 
 30 
Whatever the reason for changing the accounting basis, the vendor must make the necessary 
changes to the registered particulars on eFiling and include the adjustment on the return for 
the period concerned. Vendors need to keep the calculation and a list of debtors and creditors 
as part of their records and submit same on eFiling (if requested) or to the SARS office where 
that vendor is registered. 
Example 5 – Change in accounting basis adjustment 
S is a sole proprietor and trades under the name “ABC”. S is registered on the payments basis 
and noticed that  the turnover for the previous 1 2 months has increased to R2 ,9 million 
(exceeding the R2.5 million threshold). S notified the Commissioner within 21  days that the 
criteria to qualify for the payments basis are no longer met and should change to the invoice 
basis as from 1 March 2023. S must now make the required adjustment in respect of debtors 
and creditors. 
On 28 February 2023, S draws up the list, which reflects the balance of debtors to be R250 000 
(including VAT  at 15% ) and the balance of creditors to be R215  000 (including VAT  at 
15%).The following calculation must now be performed: 
 R 
Debtors:  250 000  
Less Creditors  215 000  
Difference  35 000 
 
If the amount owing to creditors was greater than the amount owing by debtors, the difference 
would represent input tax. For example, if S’ creditors amounted to R300 000 and the debtors 
amounted to R200 000, the calculation would have been as follows: 
 R 
Debtors:  200 000 
Less Creditors  300 000 
Difference  (100 000) 
Notes: 
1. Remember to exclude any amounts included in debtors and creditors which do not include 
VAT at the standard rate (for example, debtors and creditors for exempt or zero -rated 
supplies) and amounts payable to creditors which relate to non-permissible expenses.  
2. There is no special rate-specific rule that deals with situations where the debtors and 
creditors balances include VAT charged at different standard rates of VAT. Therefore, if 
you need to make this calculation in such a situation , you will first have to identify the 
separate debtors and creditors balances that include the different standard rates of VAT 
and then apply the relevant tax fraction to each part. You cannot merely apply the tax 
fractions 14/114 or 15/115 (as the case may be) to the full VAT -inclusive balances , 
because it will not correspond to the actual VAT that you have charged to customers or 
that you have been charged by suppliers. 
VAT on the difference is:  
R35 000 × 15 / 115 = R4 565,22  
S declares this amount in field 12 on the VAT return (output 
tax). 
VAT on the difference is:  
R100 000 × 15 / 115 = R13 043,48  
which would be deducted in field 18 on the VAT return (input 
tax). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 4 
 
 31 
4.5 Special cases 
The accounting basis will determine how much output tax must be paid or input tax may be 
deducted on a particular supply. There are , however, special provisions which treat certain 
supplies differently, irrespective of the accounting basis set out below. 
4.5.1 Instalment credit agreement 
Suppliers of taxable goods under an Instalment Credit Agreement (ICA) must account for the 
full amount of output tax in the tax period in which the goods are delivered or any payment of 
the consideration is received, whichever is the earlier, irrespective of the accounting basis on 
which they are registered. Similarly, the recipient will be able to deduct the full input tax if the 
goods were acquired for making taxable supplies unless specifically denied. 
4.5.2 Fixed property 
Vendors making taxable supplies (sales) of fixed property must account for output tax only 
insofar as the consideration for the supply has been received, irrespective of the accounting 
basis on which they are registered. Similarly , the recipient may only deduct input tax to the 
extent that payment of the consideration has been made ( that is, these supplies are treated 
as if on the payments basis), provided the time of supply has been triggered. 
4.5.3 Consideration more than R100 00061 
In the case of a supply for a consideration of R100 000 or more, vendors registered on the 
payments basis (other than  public authorities, municipalities and certain municipal entities) 
must account for the full amount of output tax in the period in which the supply occurs. In other 
words, the supply is treated as if on the invoice basis. This rule does not apply to the sale of 
fixed property as there is a special rule for these supplies as discussed in 4.5.2. 
4.5.4 Second-hand goods 
In the case of the acquisition of second-hand goods under a non-taxable supply, vendors may 
only deduct the notional input tax to the extent that payment of the consideration for the supply 
has been made by the vendor, regardless of whether that vendor is registered on the invoice 
or the payments basis . See 8.3.4 for more details on second -hand goods acquired under a 
non-taxable supply. 
4.5.5 Supplies affected by a change in the VAT rate 
There are a number of factors that a vendor must take into account when calculating the 
correct input tax and output tax for a tax period when there has been a change in the VAT 
rate. For example, on 1 April 2018 the standard rate of VAT increased from 14% to 15%.  
Vendors should be mindful of the time of supply rules for the different types of supplies made 
or received, as there may be rate-specific rules that apply. You will need to know these rules 
to establish whether you have charged the correct rate of VAT to your customers, or been 
charged the correct rate of VAT by your suppliers . This, in turn, will affect the completion of 
your VAT201 return. Although most of the consequences in this regard will be limited to the 
VAT201 returns immediately before or after 1  April 2018 (which is when the VAT rate 
increased), there are a few situations where the old standard rate of VAT will continue to apply 
for a number of months after the date that the VAT rate changed.

(FAQs): Increase in the VAT Rate and the Pocket Guide on the VAT Rate Increase on 1 April 
2018 on the SARS website. These FAQs, in particular, explain in some detail how to deal 
with the different situations which you may face in this regard. 
4.5.6 Supplies of valuable metal under the domestic reverse charge 
The DRC Regulations applies to all registered vendors that buy and sell gold and goods 
containing gold in the specified forms as provided in the definition of “valuable metal” as 
defined in the DRC Regulations. Examples of affected vendors are mines, dealers in gold, 
wholesale and retail jewellers, and coin shops. 
In the case of supplies of valuable metal between certain VAT registered vendors, the DRC 
prescribes special rules relating to accounting for the output tax and the claiming of input tax. 
Unlike conventional VAT rules, the DRC Regulations shifts the responsibility of accounting for 
VAT on the supply of valuable metal to the recipient instead of the supplier, subject to certain 
requirements set out below.  
The supplier must issue a tax invoice and account for the VAT-exclusive value of the valuable 
metal in field 3 of the VAT201 return for the tax period in which the time of supply is triggered 
(generally the earlier of payment received or invoice issued). T he recipient must account for 
output tax on the supply of valuable metal in field 12 of the VAT return, in the tax period in 
which the tax invoice is held or created by the recipient in respect of that supply (and not in 
the tax period in which the invoice is issued or payment is received by the supplier). In addition, 
the recipient will only be entitled to deduct input tax in respect of the supply of valuable metal, 
if the recipient has declared and paid the VAT in the recipients VAT201  return. The input tax 
must be claimed in field 18 of the VAT201 return. 
The DRC will only apply if the following requirements are all met: 
• The supplier is a registered vendor. 
• The recipient is a registered vendor. 
• The goods and ancillary goods or services supplied must fall within the meaning of 
“valuable metal” as defined in the DRC Regulations.62 In short, the good supplied must 
contain gold, must be in the forms specified,  and must not fall within one of the 
exclusions in the said definition. 
• The supply is taxable at the standard rate, which is currently 15%. This means that any 
supply that is zero -rated, such as the export of a valuable metal or the supply of a 
Krugerrand coin, does not fall in the DRC. 
 
62  “valuable metal” means any goods in the form of jewellery, bars, blank coins, ingots, buttons, wire, 
plate, sponge, powder, granules, in a solution, sheet, tube, strip, rod, residue or similar forms, 
containing gold, including any ancillary goods or services but does not include supplies - 
 (a) of goods produced from raw materials by any “holder” as defined in section 1 of the 
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002, or by any person 
contracted to such “holder” to carry on mining operations in respect of the mine 
where the “holder” carries on mining operations; or 
 (b) Contemplated in section 11(1)(f), (k) or (m) of the Act; 
 (c) of valuable metal containing less than 1 per cent of gold in gross weight; or  
 (d) jewellery plated with gold where the gold is present as a minor constituent only.”

The DRC Regulations also prescribes certain duties and responsibilities on the supplier and 
recipient which are further explained in the Explanatory Memorandum. More information on 
this topic is available in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Domestic Reverse Charge 
Regulations on the SARS website as well as the article “Domestic Reverse Charge 
Regulations” in VAT Connect 14.

Chapter 5  
Time and value of supply 
5.1 Introduction 
This chapter explains the time and value of supply rules which apply to certain supplies of 
goods or services. Not all of the time and value of supply rules have been included in this 
chapter, but only those which are the most common. These rules determine  when a 
transaction has occurred for VAT purposes and the value of a transaction on which VAT must 
be calculated and subsequently accounted for in a particular tax period. This is influenced not 
only by the timing and valuation rules, but also the accounting basis (see Chapter 4) and tax 
period (see  Chapter 3) which determines the due date for payment and the rendering of 
returns (see Chapter 10). 
For more details on the time of supply and value of supply, please see  sections 9 and 10 of 
the VAT Act respectively. Note that some rules which impact on the time and value of certain 
transactions may also be found elsewhere in the Act. For example, some rules can be found 
in sections 8 and 18. In addition, in the case of taxable fringe benefits, the provisions of the 
Seventh Schedule to the Income Tax Act may apply. In a case where the taxable fringe benefit 
is the use of a motor vehicle, the regulation issued under GN 283563 applies. 
5.2 Time of supply 
5.2.1 General rule 
Generally, the time of supply is the earlier of the time an invoice64 is issued by the supplier (or 
the recipient in certain instances), or the time any payment of consideration is received in 
respect of that supply. In this regard it must be noted that a “deposit” received that does not 
form part of the payment due (that i s consideration payable) for a supply, will not trigger the 
time of supply, unless and until, it is applied as payment against the consideration. 
Specific time of supply rules apply to certain transactions. A few examples are dealt with  
below. 
5.2.2 Connected persons  
A supply of goods or services where the supplier and the recipient are connected persons, is 
deemed to take place as follows: 
• If the goods supplied are to be removed – the time of supply occurs at the time the 
goods are removed. 
• If the goods supplied are not removed – the time of supply occurs at the time the goods 
are made available to the recipient. 
• If services are supplied – the time of supply occurs at the time the services are 
performed. 
 
63 GN 2835 in GG 13651 of 22 November 1991. 
64 This is any document notifying you of an obligation to make payment and is not necessarily a tax 
invoice. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 5 
 
 35 
The general time of supply rules will apply when – 
• an invoice is issued or payment is received on or before the date that a return was 
submitted (covering the tax period in which the goods or services are deemed to be 
supplied as stated above), or the last day for submitting a return for that tax period; or 
• the consideration cannot be determined at the time the supply is deemed to be made 
to a connected person who is entitled to deduct input tax in full.65 
Example 6 – Time of supply for connected persons 
Facts: 
Farmer A is a vendor registered under Category B. Farmer A rents a harvesting machine to a 
person who is connected to Farmer A (that is, Farmer B), during the peak season from January 
to March. Farmer B collected the machine from Farmer A  on 10 January 2023. Farmer A 
submits the return for February on 25 March 2023.  
Result: 
If no payment was received, and no invoice was issued by 25 March 2023, the time of supply 
will be at the time that the goods were removed on 10 January 2023. Farmer A will, therefore, 
have to account for the supply in the February 2023 return. If Farmer A issues an invoice for 
the rental on or before 25  March 2023, the normal time of supply rules apply, in which case, 
Farmer A will declare the VAT on the supply in the return ending April 2023. 
5.2.3 Progressive, successive and periodic supplies 
A supply of goods or services is deemed to be successive if the goods or services are supplied 
under a rental agreement or provision is made for periodic payments for example, in respect 
of services rendered on a monthly basis. The time of supply for each concessive supply is 
deemed to take place on the earlier of the date when payment is due or is received. Some 
examples include office and car rentals and on-going contracts for maintenance, management 
or cleaning services.66 
In the case of goods and services supplied directly in connection with the construction, repair, 
improvement, erection, manufacture, assembly or alteration of goods where the agreement 
provides for the consideration to become due and payable in instalments  or periodically in 
relation to the progress made, the time of supply is the earliest of the date when payment is 
due or is received, or any invoice relating to the payment is issued.

66 Section 9(3)(a) and (b). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 5 
 
 36 
Example 7 – Progressive supplies (construction) 
Facts: 
J’s Construction is registered for VAT under Category C tax period (monthly) and enters into 
a contract to build 50 residential units for a total contract price of R6 500 000 (VAT inclusive). 
The agreement provides for monthly progress payments to be made over a period of 
12 months. At the end of January 20 23 and February 2023, the work certified as completed 
by the appointed Project Manager was 10% and 23% respectively. J’s  Construction issued 
two tax invoices as follows: 
 ⚫ Invoice 1357 – 31 January 2023 R650 000 (10% of R6 500 000) 
 ⚫ Invoice 1358 – 28 February 2023 R845 000 (23% of R6 500 000 less R650 000 
already invoiced) 
Result: 
As the goods are deemed to be supplied progressively, J’s Construction will not account for 
the full contract price at the time the agreement is entered into. J’s Construction will account 
for VAT of R 84 782,61 (15 / 115 × R650 000) in the January 20 23 return and R 110 217,39 
(15 / 115 × R845 000) in the February 2023 return. 
5.2.4 Instalment credit agreements 
The supply of goods under an ICA is deemed to take place at the earlier of the time the goods 
are delivered, or any payment of the consideration is received by the supplier in respect of the 
supply. The goods supplied in terms of an ICA relates to corporeal movable goods and plant 
and machinery. Supplies made under an ICA are not regarded as being supplied successively 
as discussed in 5.2.3. 
5.2.5 Fixed property 
Goods consisting of fixed property or any real right therein are deemed to be supplied upon 
registration of transfer of the property in a deeds registry, or the date upon which any payment 
is made in respect of the consideration (whichever occurs first). This excludes a “deposit” as 
it is not considered to be “any payment” until the seller is able to apply that payment as 
consideration for the supply. Similarly, a payment t hat is held in trust by an estate agent or 
attorney does not constitute payment made, as the seller cannot apply the amount against the 
outstanding debt at that time. See the VAT 409 – Guide for Fixed Property and Construction 
for more details on the VAT treatment of fixed property. 
5.2.6 Fringe benefits 
The cash equivalent of a fringe benefit under the Seventh Schedule to the Income Tax Act is 
required to be included in the remuneration of the employee who has received that benefit or 
advantage for income tax purposes. The time of supply for VAT purposes is the end of the 
month in which such benefit is required to be included in the remuneration of the employee. 
In cases where the cash equivalent is not required to be included monthly or weekly in the 
amount of remuneration, the time of supply is the last day of assessment of the employee 
under the said Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 5 
 
 37 
5.2.7 Lay-by agreements 
A lay-by agreement generally relates to a supply of goods or services where the consideration 
for the supply is R10  000 or less and the supply is reserved by the payment of a deposit. In 
these types of transactions, delivery usually only takes place when the full purchase price, or 
agreed portion thereof, is paid. The supply of goods under a lay-by agreement is only deemed 
to take place when the goods are delivered to the recipient. The supplier is therefore not liable 
to account for any VAT on the amount r eceived as a deposit unless and until delivery has 
taken place. 
Should a lay-by sale be cancelled for any reason, any deposit payment retained by the vendor 
or any amount of the consideration paid (or which is recoverable) is regarded as consideration 
for a taxable supply of services by the vendor. In such cases, the v endor must account for 
output tax on the total amount retained in the tax period during which the sale was cancelled. 
5.2.8 Machines, meters and other devices 
A special time of supply rule applies when supplies are made via machines, meters and other 
devices which accept payment by way of coins, tokens, paper money or cards. 
Examples include – 
• vending machines such as those that dispense snacks, cool drinks and cigarettes; 
• arcade video games; 
• pool tables; and 
• parking meters. 
The time of supply rule for the vendor making the supply (that is the supplier) is the time that 
the coins, tokens, paper money or cards are removed from the machine, meter or device. In 
the case of payment in any other form being accepted by the machine, meter or device (for 
example, a debit or credit card), the time of supply is the time that the payment was received 
by the supplier. The time of supply for the recipient is when the coin, token, paper money or 
card is inserted into the machine, meter or device or when payment is tendered through other 
means (such as swiping the debit/credit card). 
5.2.9 Betting transactions 
A betting transaction occurs when one person places a sum of money at risk with another 
person who accepts the money as a bet, based upon the outcome of a race, competition or 
other event or occurrence where the outcome is uncertain. The time of supply rul e for the 
vendor making the supply (that is the supplier) is deemed to be supplied to the extent of the 
payment of any amount of the bet is made. The person accepting the bet is deemed to supply 
a service to the person placing the bet. A vendor accepting b ets in the course or furtherance 
of an enterprise must account for output tax on the consideration received in respect of all 
betting transactions for which payment has actually been received in the tax period concerned. 
This rule applies whether the vendo r accounts for VAT on the invoice or payments basis. 
See Interpretation Note  41 “Application of the VAT Act to the Gambling Industry” and 
BGR 59 “Calculation of VAT for table games of chance” (relating to casinos) f or more 
information. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 5 
 
 38 
5.2.10 Supplies made by a branch 
In the case of an entity that conducts its activities through a single company which has both a 
South African establishment (SA Branch) and an offshore establishment, the enterprise 
carried on through the SA Branch is deemed to be carried on by a separate person from the 
offshore establishment. This rule applies if each enterprise is independent and can be 
separately identified with reference to their separate accounting records and location of the 
enterprise. Any goods or services supplied by the SA Branch to the offshore establishment 
will, in that case, be recognised for VAT purposes. The time of supply will be when the goods 
are consigned or physically delivered to the offshore establishment or when the services are 
rendered to the offshore establishment. 
5.3 Value of supply 
5.3.1 General rule 
The value of a supply for VAT purposes is directly linked to the consideration received for the 
said supply. In this regard, the consideration for a supply will normally be equal to the amount 
of money which is payable as the price charged for the supply. The consideration for a supply 
is represented by the value plus the VAT charged. In cases where the consideration is not in 
money, the consideration will be the OMV thereof. The OMV includes the VAT element. 
Specific value of supply rules apply to certain transactions. Note that although section  10 of 
the VAT Act is titled “Value of supply”, some of the subparagraphs in that section prescribe 
the consideration for the supply instead of the value of the supply. Some examples follow 
below. 
5.3.2 Connected persons 
The normal value of supply rules also apply to connected persons. However, in the case of a 
supply made for no consideration, or for a consideration which is below the OMV , or for a  
consideration which cannot be determined at the time the supply is made, the consideration 
for the supply is equal to the OMV if the recipient would not have been entitled to a full input 
tax deduction on the goods or services acquired, had the OMV been ch arged in respect of 
that supply. This rule is not applicable where the supply concerned is a fringe benefit to an 
employee (not being a “connected person”) as there are other special rules which apply in 
those situations. See 5.3.6. 
5.3.3 Instalment credit agreements 
The consideration in money is deemed to be the cash value of the supply. The cash value 
excludes any interest, finance charges and related admin fees but includes VAT and the sales 
amount for which the goods were sold. In the case of a banker or financier,  the cash value 
includes the sales amount for which the goods were sold, for example, the purchase price and 
any other costs borne by the banker. In the case of a dealer of such goods, the cash value is 
the price at which the goods are normally sold by the dealer and other related costs (such as 
installation, assembly, erection) that form part of the capital amount financed under the ICA. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 5

5.3.4 Commercial accommodation 
The supply of commercial accommodation is a taxable supply. Commercial accommodation 
includes board or board and lodging supplied together with domestic goods and services67 (for 
example, meals, laundry services, the use of a  telephone) in a house, flat, apartment, room, 
hotel, guest house etc.  
Commercial accommodation excludes the letting or hiring of a dwelling which constitutes the 
place of residence of a natural person or the supply of employee housing, both of which are 
exempt supplies. See 2.1.6 for more details on commercial accommodation activities and 7.2 
on the activities for the letting or hiring of a dwelling. 
Should a person stay in an establishment which provides commercial accommodation for an 
unbroken period of more than 28  days, only 60% of the all -inclusive charge for the 
accommodation and the domestic goods and services is subject to VAT at the standard rate. 
The full amount charged is subject to VAT at the standard rate when a person stays for a 
period less than 28 days. Any domestic goods and services which are charged separately and 
are not included in the all -inclusive tariff for the accommodation, are  also taxed in full at the 
standard rate. See the VAT 411 – Guide for Entertainment Accommodation and Catering for 
more information. 
5.3.5 Barter transactions 
In barter transactions, goods or services are exchanged for other goods or services. Payment 
of the consideration may also be partly in money, and partly in goods and/or services 
exchanged. To the extent that payment of the consideration is made in money, the 
consideration for the supply will be the amount of money. To the extent that payment is not in 
money, the consideration is the OMV of the goods or services received. 
Example 8 – Barter transaction 
Facts: 
ABC Rugby Club has received a sponsorship contract from C Hardware Stores  in terms of 
which they are provided with rugby kits to the value of R10 000 as well as R5 000 in cash. In 
exchange, ABC Rugby Club will provide advertising, publicity and exposure of the C Hardware 
Stores brand. Both ABC Rugby Club and C Hardware Stores are vendors.

Input tax (15 / 115 × R10 000) R1 304 Input tax (15 / 115 × R15 000)  R1 957 
Input tax is allowed on any taxable goods or services acquired to make taxable supplies. 
Money is not regarded as either goods or services for VAT purposes and ABC Rugby Club 
can only deduct input tax on the OMV of the rugby kit acquired. C Hardware Stores will be 
entitled to deduct input tax on the advertising and publicity services it received. 
5.3.6 Fringe benefits 
The consideration in money is deemed to be the cash equivalent of the benefit granted to the 
employee as determined in the Seventh Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The VAT on the 
fringe benefit must be calculated by the employer and must be reflected in the employer’s VAT 
return, even if the employer does not recover the VAT from the employee enjoying the fringe 
benefit. Note that a benefit or advantage arising by virtue of an exempt or zero -rated supply, 
or granted in the course of making exempt supplies, or a supply of entertainment is not subject 
to tax.  
The consideration for a benefit that consists of a right to use a motor vehicle is determined in 
terms of the regulation issued under GN2835.68 For more information on the determination of 
the value of the fringe benefit, see Interpretation Note 82 “Input Tax on Motor Cars”. 
Example 9 – Motor vehicle supplied as a fringe benefit 
Facts: 
D’s Wholesalers (a vendor registered under Category B tax period) purchases a “motor car” 
for R115 000 (including VAT of R15 000) on 1 March 2023. D’s Wholesalers is not entitled to 
deduct input tax on the acquisition of the “motor car” as it is a prohibited deduction.  
An employee of D’s Wholesalers (who is paid monthly) is granted the right to use the motor 
car with effect from 1 March 2023, and D’s Wholesalers bears the full cost of maintaining the 
vehicle.  
Result: 
D’s Wholesalers must account for output tax on the supply of the fringe benefit as follows: 
Step 1 Consideration in money = determined value of the motor car × 0,003 (0,3%) 
 (see VAT Regulation 2835 dated 22 November 1991) 
  = (R115 000 – R15 000) × 0,003 = R300 
Step 2 The amount of output tax payable per month will be: 
  R300 × 15 / 115 = R39,13 
 
 
68 GN 2835 in GG 13651 of 22 November 1991. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors  Chapter 5 
 
 41 
Step 3 The first tax period covers the months of March 20 23 and April 2023. Output tax 
on the fringe benefit for the tax period must be declared in Field 12 of the VAT201 return and 
paid on 25 May 2023. This must also be done for every tax period thereafter as follows: 
  R39,13 × 2 months = R78,26  
Note that where the input tax on acquisition of the vehicle was allowed (for example, a bakkie) 
the consideration in money is calculated by applying a factor of 0,006 (0,6%) instead of 0,003 
(0,3%). 
In a case where the employee bears the full cost of the repairs and maintenance, and receives 
no compensation in the form of an allowance or reimbursement from the vendor to the 
employee in respect of the such cost, the consideration in money so determined monthly must 
as determined above be reduced by the lesser of R85 or the consideration for the fringe benefit 
determined monthly. 
5.3.7 Consideration only partly for a taxable supply 
In cases where the consideration relates only partly to a taxable supply of goods or services, 
VAT is calculated only on that portion of the consideration which is properly attributable to the 
taxable supply. For example, when a tour operator charges a non-resident for a tour package 
in RSA, the VAT is calculated and paid, based on the consideration attributable to the 
individual component supplies, for example –F
69 
• international travel is subject to VAT at the zero rate; 
• tour guide services are subject to VAT at the standard rate;  
• hotel accommodation is subject to VAT at the standard rate; and 
• airport shuttle passenger transport is exempt from VAT. 
5.3.8 Betting transactions 
A vendor that accepts a bet from any person (the punter) on the outcome of a race or on any 
other event is deemed to make a supply of betting services to the punter. The consideration 
for the betting services is the total amount received in respect of the bet. Output tax is 
calculated by applying the tax fraction to the gross amount of the bet received.  
 
For more information see Interpretation Note 84 “The Value-Added Tax Treatment of Bets”. 
 
For betting transactions involving table games of chance in casinos, see BGR 59 “Calculation 
of VAT for table games of chance”.

Chapter 6  
Taxable supplies 
6.1 Introduction 
The term “supply” is widely defined in the VAT  Act to include performance under any sale, 
rental agreement or ICA. It also includes all other forms of supply, whether voluntary, 
compulsory or by operation of law, irrespective of where the supply is effected, and includes 
any derivative of the term. The term “taxable supplies” includes all supplies made by a vendor 
in the course or furtherance of an enterprise on which VAT should be levied at the standard 
rate or the zero rate. 70 As exempt supplies are not taxable supplies, no output tax is levied 
and no input tax may be deducted on any expenses attributable to making exempt supplies. 
This chapter only addresses the VAT implications of taxable supplies. Exempt supplies are 
dealt with in Chapter 7. 
6.2 Standard-rated supplies 
A supply of goods or services by a vendor is normally subject to VAT at the standard rate 
(currently 15%). As explained in Chapter 1, as a general rule, all taxable supplies of goods 
and services are subject to VAT at the  standard rate, unless they are specifically zero-rated 
under section 11 (see 6.3), or exempt under section 12 (see Chapter 7). 
The following are some examples of standard-rated supplies (the list is not exhaustive): 
• Land and buildings (fixed property) – commercial or residential property bought from 
property developers, building materials, vacant land bought from a vendor and so forth. 
• Professional services – construction/building, estate agents, consultants, architects, 
engineers, project managers, doctors, private hospital services, lawyers, plumbers, 
electricians and accountants. 
• Household consumables and durable goods – most grocery items and foodstuffs such 
as meat, fish, white bread, snacks, most canned foods, cigarettes, perfume, medicines, 
cool drinks, cleaning materials, clothing, footwear, microwave ovens and other 
household consumables and appliances. 
• Municipal goods and services such as electricity, water and refuse removal. (See  the 
VAT 419 – Guide for Municipalities). 
• Accommodation, hospitality, tourism and entertainment – restaurant meals, hotel 
accommodation, liquor sales, arcade amusements, casino slot machines and 
gambling services, entrance fees to sporting events, theatre performances and film 
shows, guided tours, game drives and game hunting expeditions. See the VAT 411 – 
Guide for Entertainment Accommodation and Catering for more information. 
• Capital assets such as furniture, production machinery, installations, motor vehicles 
and equipment. 
• Local transport of goods (all modes of transport) and the local transport of passengers 
by air or sea. 
• Telephone, internet, computer and other telecommunication services. 
• Rental of goods and commercial property such as office space. 
 
70 See Chapter 2 for more details on “enterprise”.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 43 
• Motor vehicles, repair services, lubrication oils and spare parts. 
6.2.1 Deemed supplies 
As a registered vendor, you may sometimes be required to declare an amount of output tax 
even though you have not actually supplied any goods or services. The VAT  Act contains 
deeming provisions which both widen the range of transactions subject to VAT and clarify the 
instances where certain transactions will be deemed to be taxable or not, or deemed not to be 
supplied in the course or furtherance of an enterprise. Deemed supplies will generally attract 
VAT at either the standard rate or zero rate. 
Examples of deemed supplies on which a vendor has to account for output tax at the standard 
rate include – 
• trading stock taken out of the business for private use; 
• certain fringe benefits provided to staff; 
• assets retained upon ceasing to carry on an enterprise – when a vendor deregisters 
as a vendor, certain goods or rights forming part of the enterprise’s assets are deemed 
to be supplied in the course of the vendor’s enterprise, immediately before the person 
ceased to be a vendor, irrespective of when those assets may have been acquired, 
subject to certain exceptions; 
• short-term (non-life) insurance claims that have been paid in connection with the 
enterprise (for  example, insurance payouts received for damaged or stolen stock) 
(see the VAT 421 – Guide for Short-Term Insurance and BGR 14 “VAT Treatment of 
Specific Supplies in the Short-Term Insurance Industry”); 
• the receipt of payments from government by designated entities for the purposes of 
taxable supplies (see the VAT 414 – Guide for Associations not for Gain and Welfare 
Organisations); 
• betting and other gambling transactions (see Interpretation Note 41 “Application of the 
VAT Act to the Gambling Industry”); and 
• change in use adjustments (see Chapter 9). 
Example 10– Insurance indemnity payment (deemed supply) 
Facts: 
P is a vendor and P’s delivery driver was involved in an accident on 5 January 2023 in which 
the delivery van was damaged. P  subsequently makes a claim to P’s insurer to make good 
the damages as per the policy contract. The insurer makes an electronic payment of R57 000 
on 1 February 2023 to compensate for the loss.  
Result: 
As P is a vendor and registered under Category B tax period, and the delivery van was used 
in P’s enterprise, the indemnity payment is deemed to be received in the course of P’s 
enterprise. P must therefore account for output tax in the February 2023 return. The VAT is 
calculated as the tax fraction of the amount received, as follows: 
 R57 000 × 15 / 115 = R7 435. 
 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 44 
Example 11 – Trading stock taken out of business for private use (deemed supply) 
Facts: 
AB, a vendor, owns a paint and décor store. During February 20 23, AB decides to paint the 
exterior of a private residence used by AB using paint from AB’s store.  
Result: 
Since AB uses paint from trading stock in order to paint the home, a supply is deemed to be 
made. AB must accordingly account for output tax on the OMV of the paint used as follows: 
 Output tax: R28 000 × 15 / 115 = R3 652. 
6.3 Zero-rated supplies 
Zero-rated supplies are taxable supplies on which VAT is levied at a rate of 0%. The 
application of the zero  rate must be supported by documentary proof acceptable to the 
Commissioner. Vendors making zero-rated supplies are still able to deduct input tax in full on 
the goods or services acquired in the making of the zero -rated supplies. The documentary 
requirements under section 11(3) and set out in Interpretation Note 30 “The Supply of Movable 
Goods as Contemplated in Section 11(1)(a)(i) read with Paragraph (a) of the Definition of 
‘Exported’ and the Corresponding Documentary Proof”  and Interpretation Note  31 
“Documentary Proof Required for the Zero -Rating of Goods or Services” , respectively. See 
also Chapter 12 for more detail on exports and the documentation required. 
Some examples of zero-rated supplies are briefly explained below: 
6.3.1 Basic foodstuffs 
Certain basic foodstuffs listed as items in Part B to Schedule 2 read with section 11(1)(j) are 
zero-rated. These include the following: 
• brown bread • dried mealies and mealie rice 
• brown bread flour (excluding wheaten 
bran) 
• samp 
• hens eggs71  • fresh vegetables and fruit72  
• dried beans • lentils 
• maize meal73 • rice 
• pilchards in tins or cans • vegetable cooking oil (excluding olive 
oil)74 
• milk, cultured milk, milk powder and 
dairy powder blend 
• edible legumes and pulses of 
leguminous plants (that is, peas, beans, 
peanuts etc) 
 
71 That is, not from ostriches, ducks etc. 
72 See BGR 35 “The Value -Added Tax Treatment of the Supply and Importation of Potato Products 
and BGR 38 “The Value-Added Tax Treatment of the Supply and Importation of Vegetables and 
Fruit” for more information. 
73  Certain specified graded maize products are listed in the Item. The list was expanded with effect 
from 1 April 2022 to include super fine maize meal. 
74 See BGR  33 “The VAT Treatment of the Supply or Importation of Vegetable Oil”  for more 
information. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 45 
The specific item descriptions in Schedule 2 contain more details about the requirements to 
be met and products concerned that fall within the scope of the zero-rating. Certain products 
are specifically mentioned as exclusions, and in some cases, the conditions under which the 
products are supplied, packaged or manufactured may prevent the zero -rate from being 
applicable.   
For example, the zero rate will not apply where – 
• Zero-rated foodstuffs are prepared for immediate consumption for example – 
➢ a glass of milk served in a restaurant; 
➢ a pre-packed salad with salad dressing purchased at a supermarket; 
➢ sandwiches and other take-away foods. 
• A standard rated product or ingredient is supplied together with a zero-rated foodstuff 
for example – 
➢ a punnet of vegetables seasoned with herbs and including a stick of butter; 
➢ a pack of rice or beans containing a sachet of flavouring; 
➢ a gift hamper consisting of a basket of fruit with chocolates and nuts. 
6.3.2 Fuel levy goods 
Most motor fuels are subject to taxes such as the General Fuel Levy, the Road Accident Fund 
Levy as well as excise duty. The VAT  Act therefore provides that certain specified “fuel levy 
goods” are subject to the zero rate. These include crude oil and certain petrol and diesel based 
products (including biodiesel), which are used as fuel in internal combustion engines. 
Examples include fuels used in motor cars, trucks, buses, ships, fishing boats, railway 
locomotives, farming and production machinery. 
Petroleum oils and crude oil which are refined for the production of fuel levy goods are also 
zero-rated; however, aviation kerosene, motor oil and oil lubricants are subject to the standard 
rate. 
The sale of “marked” illuminating kerosene (paraffin) intended for use as fuel or for heating is 
subject to VAT at the zero rate. Any “unmarked” illuminating paraffin or other forms of paraffin 
which are blended or mixed with any other products are subject to the standard rate of VAT. 
6.3.3 Going concern 
The supply of an enterprise or part of an enterprise which is capable of separate operation as 
a going concern qualifies for the zero rate if all of the requirements are met under 
section 11(1)(e). The supply of the enterprise will be subject to VAT at the standard rate if any 
of the requirements are not met. 
In addition, it must be clearly evident, and agreed to in writing by the parties, that the enterprise 
is disposed of as a going concern. It is important to note that the subject of the agreement 
must be an “enterprise” as a going concern. In other words, the merx of the contract must be 
the business or enterprise, which includes, amongst others, all the necessary income earning 
business assets and client base. A contract for the sale of individual physical assets such as 
fixed property cannot be treated as a going concern under section  11(1)(e). For example, 
where a vendor sells the property from where its business is conducted, the subject of the 
supply is the fixed property and not the enterprise. In that case, VAT must be charged at the 
standard rate whether income is earned from that fixed property or not. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 46 
An enterprise is considered to be supplied as a going concern if – 
• the supplier and the recipient are both registered vendors; 
• the supplier and the recipient agree in writing that such enterprise is supplied as a 
going concern; 
• the sale agreement provides that the enterprise will be an income -earning activity on 
the date of transfer from the supplier thereof to the recipient; 
• the assets which are necessary for carrying on such enterprise are disposed of by the 
supplier to the recipient; and 
• the supplier and the recipient agree in writing that the consideration for the supply of 
the enterprise is inclusive of tax at the zero rate. 
See VAT-REG-02-G01 – Guide for Completion of VAT Registration Application Forms – 
External Guide and Interpretation Note 57 “Sale of an Enterprise or Part Thereof as a Going 
Concern” for more details on the supply of an enterprise as a going concern. 
The following are some examples of cases which are not regarded as the disposal of an 
income-earning activity: 
• The sale of a bakery business without the ovens. 
• The sale and leaseback of a commercial building. 
• The disposal of a business yet to commence. 
• The disposal of a dormant business. 
The enterprise sold does not have to be profitable at the date of transfer but the enterprise 
activities must be able to continue after the sale of the enterprise. The inclusion of goodwill as 
an asset in the sale of the enterprise is generally indicative that a business is being sold as a 
going concern. 
6.3.4 Services relating to intellectual property rights 
Services supplied in connection with intellectual property rights for use outside the Republic 
are taxable supplies which are subject to VAT at the zero rate. Any ancillary services supplied 
together with these intellectual property rights may also be zero-rated. Should the intellectual 
property rights be used in the Republ ic, all services supplied in connection with such 
intellectual property rights must be standard rated. 
6.3.5 Certain p ayments to welfare organisations  made by public authorities and 
municipalities 
To the extent that  a welfare organisation receives a subsidy or grant payment from a public 
authority or municipality to enable it to carry on its welfare activities as listed in the 
Regulations,75 that welfare organisation is deemed to supply services at the zero  rate to the 
public authority or municipality. This excludes any payment for actual supplies made to the 
public authority or municipality, or payment for a specific supply made to a third person on 
behalf of that public authority or municipality. See  2.3.3 and Interpretation Note  39 “VAT 
Treatment of Public Authorities and Grants” for more information.76 
 
75 Refers to the regulations issued under GN 112 in GG 27235 of 11 February 2005.  
76 See also CSARS v Marshall NO and Others  [2016] ZASCA 158; 2017 (1) SA 114 (SCA) and 
Interpretation Note 70 “Supplies made for No Consideration”.

 47 
6.3.6 Foreign donor funded project 
A vendor that is appointed as an “implementing agency” in respect of implementing, operating, 
administering or managing an FDFP in the Republic is deemed to supply a service to an 
international donor to the extent of donor funds received from the international donor. The 
supply of the said service is taxable at the rate of 0%. See  2.1.4 for more details on FDFPs. 
6.3.7 Goods temporarily imported for repairs 
The supply of services directly in connection with goods that are temporarily admitted into the 
RSA for processing, repair, cleaning or reconditioning is subject to VAT at the zero-rate. Any 
goods which are consumed or permanently affixed to those goods as a consequence of the 
services being rendered will also be zero -rated. This also applies to foreign -going ships or 
aircraft. In order for the zero -rating to apply, the vendor must be in possession of, amongst 
other documentary requirements, a copy of the SARS Customs Declaration evidencing the 
temporary import as well as the corresponding release notification. See Interpretation Note 31 
“Documentary Proof Required for the Zero-Rating of Goods or Services” for more information 
on the documentation required by a vendor in order to apply the zero -rating to the supply of 
goods and services 
Example 12 – Repair of a foreign-going aircraft 
Facts: 
A foreign-going aircraft needs repairs to be carried out to its landing gear while stationed at 
the Cape Town International Airport. A local vendor is contracted to do the repairs.  
Result: 
The services (labour) and spare parts (welding rods, gas, welding plates etc) used in the 
repairs may be zero-rated. In order to apply the zero-rate, the vendor doing the repairs should 
obtain and retain, the prescribed documentation for example, the particulars of the foreign -
going aircraft (that is, the make, name, registration number and country of registration). 
6.3.8 International transport 
The international transport of goods or passengers is zero -rated. This includes the  
cross-border transport of goods or passengers from a place outside the RSA into the RSA or 
vice versa. The transportation of goods or passengers between two places outside the RSA 
also qualifies for the zero-rate. 
In a case where the transport of goods is between two places in the RSA which is part of the 
international transportation service, the local leg of the transport is zero -rated to the extent 
that the same supplier is contractually liable to the same recipie nt for both the local and 
international portions of the transportation service. This does not necessarily mean that the 
service must physically be performed by the same supplier. The supplier may choose to sub-
contract the work to another vendor but must r emain contractually liable to the recipient for 
the relevant part of the transportation. Similarly, the local leg of a passenger flight that forms 
part of an international journey by air is zero-rated to the extent that it constitutes “international 
carriage” as defined in Article 1 of the Convention set out in the Schedule to the Carriage by 
Air Act 17 of 1946.77
 
  
 
77 The VAT Act does not define the term “international carriage”. For more details, see I nterpretation 
Note 103 “The value -added tax treatment of supplies of international and ancillary transport 
services”. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 48 
 
Example 13 – International transport services 
Facts: 
Passenger X purchases an air-ticket from Airline A (vendor) for the flight from Cape Town to 
London (England). Airline A contracts with Airline C (vendor) to fly Passenger X from Cape 
Town to Johannesburg, from where Airline A flies Passenger X to London. 
What is the VAT treatment of the passenger flights? 
Result: 
Airline C is supplying a domestic passenger flight to Airline A and VAT at the standard rate 
must be levied. The zero rate is not applicable as Airline C is not contractually supplying the 
domestic leg of an international passenger flight. 
Airline A is supplying an international transport service, which incorporates a domestic leg, to 
Passenger X, originating at a place in the RSA (Cape Town) and ending in an export country 
(London). Airline A must charge VAT at the zero rate under section 11(2)(a)(ii) and 
section 11(2)(b) respectively. 
6.3.9 Land situated in an export country 
Any service supplied directly in connection with land situated outside the RSA is zero -rated. 
For example, where a South African resident contracts with a South African vendor to build a 
house situated in Botswana, the zero rate will apply. 
6.3.10 Services physically performed outside the Republic 
The supply of services physically rendered or performed outside the RSA, or to a customs 
controlled area enterprise or a special economic zone operator in a customs controlled area 
qualifies for the zero rate. 78 This provision applies to both residents and non -residents. For 
example, if a South African vendor renders a consulting service in Botswana for a client in that 
country, those services are subject to VAT at the zero rate. 
6.3.11 Certain services supplied to non-residents 
The supply of certain services to a non -resident may qualify for the zero rate  under 
section 11(2)(l) provided certain conditions are met. However, the standard rate will apply in 
the following cases where the services are supplied directly – 
• in connection with fixed property (land and improvements) situated in the Republic;  
• in connection with  movable property which is situated in the RSA at the time the 
services are rendered, except if the – 
➢ movable property is subsequently exported; 
➢ non-resident is not in the RSA when the service is rendered; or 
➢ services supplied by the RSA vendor form part of a supply by the non-resident to 
the recipient vendor in the RSA and the services are acquired wholly for taxable 
purposes by that recipient; or 
 
78 See Interpretation Note 40 “VAT Treatment of the Supply of Goods and/or Services to and/or from 
a Customs Controlled Area of an Industrial Development Zone” for more details in this regard.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 49 
It is also a condition of the zero-rating under section 11(2)(l) that the non-resident person (or 
any other person consuming the service) is not present in the RSA at the time the services 
are rendered. 
The supply of services to non -residents must be tested against all the exclusions in sub-
paragraphs (i) to (iii) of section 11(2)(l) in order to qualify for the zero-rating. 
Example 14 – Services supplied by a vendor to a non -resident in respect of movable 
property 
(a) Movable property subsequently exported 
Facts: 
GR is an RSA vendor and a supplier of mining equipment. GR supplies a machine to KM, a 
Belgian company that is not an RSA resident and not a vendor in the RSA. KM will take 
delivery of the machine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), but before GR can export 
the machine, it has to be calibrated so that it can be used in the DRC. KM therefore acquires 
the services of CI (an RSA vendor) to calibrate the machine at the premises of GR before 
exportation. 
Result: 
The services supplied by CI will be made directly in connection with movable goods situated 
in the RSA. As a result, VAT would usually be charged at the standard rate. However, as the 
machine will subsequently be exported to KM, the supply of services by C I (including any 
incidental goods incorporated into the machine, or consumed in the process of rendering the 
calibration services) will be subject to VAT at the zero rate.  
(b) RSA vendor’s supply is part of the non-resident’s supply to a recipient vendor 
Facts: 
K is a German resident which supplies extrusion machines to manufacturers in the plastics 
industry worldwide. It does not carry on an enterprise in RSA. B is a n RSA vendor and a 
manufacturer of various plastic products. It purchases an extrusion machine from K on the 
understanding that K will also do the necessary installation work. K sub -contracts the 
installation work to LBW (an RSA vendor) who will perform the necessary services on behalf 
of K at B’s premises.  
Result: 
The supply of the service by LBW forms part of the supply by K to B and the supply by LBW 
to K (who is not an RSA resident nor a vendor) is therefore subject to VAT at the zero rate.  
See Interpretation Note 85 “The Master Currency Case” 79 in which the Court confirms the 
Commissioner’s interpretation of the zero-rating provisions in section  11(2)(l) and  
Interpretation Note  81 “The Supply of Goods and Services by Professional Hunters and 
Taxidermists to Non-residents” for more information.

6.3.12 Restraint of trade agreements  
A restraint of trade agreement places an obligation on one of the parties to such agreement, 
to refrain from pursuing or exercising specific rights. The supply of services under a restraint 
of trade agreement concerning the exercise of those rights listed in paragraph  (i) of 
section 11(2)(m)80 for use outside of the Republic is zero -rated. The supply of services in 
respect of a restraint of trade of rights to be used in the RSA is standard-rated. 
6.3.13 Municipal property rates 
Any municipal property rates charged by a municipality are subject to the zero rate. However, 
the municipal rates charge must be separate and distinct from other charges levied for goods 
or services by that municipality. Therefore, where a municipality cha rges a “flat rate” which 
includes a charge for municipal rates, plus other charges for water, electricity, refuse removal 
or other standard-rated goods or services supplied, the entire charge is subject to the standard 
rate. 
6.3.14 Farming goods 
Many of the products which are produced or consumed in the course of conducting a farming 
enterprise are zero-rated, or exempt from VAT on importation. However the zero-rating will be 
repealed from a date to be determined by the Minister and published by way of a notice in the 
GG. 
The changes to the law from the effective date will affect farmers as follows: 
• Zero-rating – The zero-rating under section 11(1)(g) will no longer apply in respect of 
the purchase of agricultural, pastoral or other goods described in Part A to Schedule 2. 
• Exemption on importation – The exemption from VAT in Paragraph  7 to Schedule  1 
with regard to the importation of the goods mentioned in Part  A to Schedule 2 will no 
longer apply. 
Until the concessions discussed above are repealed, the goods listed in Part A of Schedule 2 
may be purchased locally at the zero  rate or imported exempt from VAT, subject to the 
conditions prescribed in the said Schedule. 
Some examples of these goods are – 
• stock licks; 
• fertiliser; 
• seed; 
• pesticide; 
• remedies or medicines (but not in respect of other items charged such as syringes or 
vet’s fees); 
• animal, poultry, fish or game feed (this includes any vitamins, bone products or maize 
products); and 
• plants – this includes trees, bulbs, roots, cuttings or similar plant products used for 
cultivation. 
 
80 Such as filing, assignment, licensing, including patents, designs, trade-marks. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 6 
 
 51 
In order to be able to purchase the above goods at the zero rate, the following requirements 
must be met: 
• The vendor must be in possession of a Notice of Registration81 indicating the vendor’s 
entitlement to acquire the goods at the zero rate.73F
 With the implementation of the single 
registration process, the VAT103 was replaced with the new Notice of Registration 
which is a standard notice of registration across all tax types (except Customs and 
Excise). 
• The Notice of Registration must be presented to the supplier (for example , co-
operatives and abattoirs) who will then keep a record of certain particulars appearing 
thereon to justify the application of the zero rate on supplies made to the purchaser as 
contemplated in Interpretation Note 31. 
• The VAT registration number of the purchaser must appear on the tax invoice. 
• The goods supplied must be specified in Part A of Schedule 2 to the VAT Act. 
If SARS finds that the above conditions have not been met, the supplies in question will be 
subject to VAT at the standard rate. 
Note that the zero -rating in respect of the agricultural products concerned will not apply 
where – 
• other goods or services not listed above are supplied to the agricultural industry . For 
example, it will not apply to the consultation fee charged by a vet to attend to a sick 
animal, nor would it apply to the goods or services acquired to install a new irrigation 
system; 
• the sale of the goods concerned is prohibited under section 7bis of the Fertilisers, Farm 
Feed Agricultural Remedies Act  36 of 1947, for example, the sale of a banned 
substance such as dichlor-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT); or 
• such products are purchased for purposes of resale. 
Part B of Schedule 2 to the VAT Act lists the basic foodstuffs which are subject to VAT at the 
zero rate. Many of these products are sold by farming enterprises for example, raw fruit and 
vegetables, maize, milk, eggs, beans, mealies. Please remember to show the total 
consideration in field 2 on your VAT return – failure to do so will result in unnecessary audits. 
Also remember that a farmer who receives income from a harvest (crop sharing), must pay 
VAT at the standard rate on that portion of the proceeds unless the supplies are zero-rated 
under any of the items in Schedule 2 to the VAT Act as discussed above. 
 
  
 
81  Only vendors that are registered as conducting a farming, agricultural or pastoral enterprise as their 
main activity qualify for this dispensation. It is a requirement that a statement must appear on the 
Notice of Registration indicating that certain farmi ng inputs may be purchased at the zero rate, 
subject to certain conditions. The older versions of the Notice of Registration were known as the 
“VAT registration certificate” or “VAT 103” and contained a similar statement in clause no. 7 of the 
document.

Chapter 7  
Exempt and out of scope supplies 
7.1 Introduction 
Exempt and out of scope supplies  are supplies of goods or services where no VAT is levied 
and input tax may not be deducted on the VAT incurred to make these supplies. A business 
that only makes exempt supplies does not carry on an “enterprise” for VAT purposes 
(see Chapter 2) and is therefore unable to register as a vendor irrespective of the number or 
value of the supplies made. 
Some examples of exempt supplies include – 
• financial services (such as the provision of credit, life insurance, the services of benefit 
funds such as medical schemes, provident, pension and retirement annuity funds); 
• donated goods or services sold by non -profit bodies (such as religious and welfare 
organisations);  
• the sale of goods manufactured by an association not for gain if at least 80% of the 
value of the supply consists of donated goods or services; 
• residential accommodation in a dwelling (but not commercial holiday accommodation); 
• passenger transport in South Africa by taxi, bus or train; 
• educational services provided by recognised educational institutions such as primary 
and secondary schools, technical colleges, or universities which have been approved 
as public benefit organisations (PBOs) under section  30(3) of the Income Tax Act, or 
an organisation which has been approved by the Commissioner as being exempt 
under section 10(1)(cA)(i) of that Act; 
• childcare services provided at crèches and after-school care centres; and 
• services provided to members of body corporates, share block companies, retired 
persons, political parties, trade unions, housing schemes and home -owners 
associations which are supplied out of levy contributions by such members. 
7.2 Letting of dwellings 
VAT is not levied on the supply of a dwelling under a lease agreement. This rule also applies 
to employee housing supplied by an employer. A “dwelling” is basically defined as a building 
or a part of a building which is used, or intended to be used, as the  residence of a natural 
person, and includes any fixtures and furnishings enjoyed with the supply of the dwelling. The 
definition excludes the supply of “commercial accommodation”. See 2.1.6. 
The letting of land to the extent that the land is used or is to be used for the principal purpose 
of accommodation in a dwelling either erected or to be erected on such land is also exempt 
from VAT. 
7.3 Passenger transport (road and rail) 
The supply of passenger transport by road or rail is exempt from VAT if the transportation is – 
• between two places within the RSA; 
• of fare-paying passengers and their baggage or belongings; and 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 7 
 
 53 
• supplied in the course of a transport business (taxi operators/bus and rail companies) 
in a vehicle operated by the supplier of the transportation service or a person acting as 
the supplier’s agent. 
The following points should also be noted with regard to exempt passenger transportation: 
• A charge or fee levied for a game -viewing drive does not fall within the ambit of this 
exemption and VAT at the standard rate must be levied. 
• The transportation of goods does not fall within the exemption, except to the extent 
that it relates to the transportation of the personal belongings and baggage 
accompanying the fare-paying passenger. 
• Transportation of passengers by air and sea between two places with the RSA 
constitutes a standard -rated supply and does not fall within the exemption. The 
exemption is also not applicable in respect of car -rental businesses and the free 
transportation of employees. 
• The exemption includes various types of commuter transport, for example, suburban 
and mainline trains, mainline and luxury bus travelling services as well as taxis. 
7.4 Educational and childcare services 
The supply of educational services by the following entities is exempt from VAT:  
• All State schools, schools registered under the South African Schools Act,82 and further 
education and training (FET) institution s registered under the Further Education and 
Training Act.83  
• Universities, universities of technologies (previously known as technikons), colleges 
and other institutions providing higher education which are registered under the Higher 
Education Act.84  
• Institutions which are approved PBOs under section  30(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 
which supply – 
➢ adult basic education and training (ABET); 
➢ education and training of religious or social workers; 
➢ education and training of persons with permanent physical or mental 
impairment; or 
➢ bridging courses to indigent persons to enable them to enter a higher education 
institution. 
The supply of the services of crèches and after-school care centres are also exempt from VAT 
under section 12(j). The supply of lodging or boarding and lodging in certain instances by 
institutions such as schools, universities, colleges or universities of technology is also exempt, 
provided amongst others; it is supplied for a consideration in the form of school fe es, tuition 
fees or payment for lodging or board and lodging. 
 
82 Act 84 of 1996. 
83 Act 16 of 2006. 
84 Act 101 of 1997. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 7 
 
 54 
Example 15 – Crèche and after-school care 
Facts: 
BB runs a crèche and an after-school care centre. BB charges R1 000 per month for each of 
the 120 children which are enrolled at the centre. BB’s expenses amount to R57  435 per 
month, of which R7 435 is VAT.  
Result: 
Annual Income (R1 000 × 120) R120 000 × 12 = R1 440 000 
Annual expenses (including VAT)  R  57 435 × 12 = R   689 220 
BB will not register as a vendor because BB is providing exempt services of caring for children 
in a crèche even though the annual income is in excess of the R1  million threshold. As BB 
may not register for VAT, the R 7 435 VAT incurred per month cannot be deducted as input 
tax, and consequently, the amount will form part of the business costs of running the crèche 
and after-school facility. 
7.5 Financial services 
One of the most common examples of exempt financial services as contemplated in the Act 
is the provision of credit.  Essentially, the provision of credit is where one person under an 
agreement provides money to another person who agrees to repay an amount in excess of 
the money borrowed. The provision of credit under an agreement includes for example, the 
provision of a home loan or an overdraft facility. 
Other examples of financial services which will normally be exempt are – 
• the exchange of currency by issuing bank notes or coins or even debiting and crediting 
transaction or credit accounts. For example, the rand value given for dollars is exempt, 
but any fee charged for the exchange service will be taxable at the standard rate; 
• equity or participatory securities. For example, participating in a collective investment 
scheme, the sale of an interest in a CC, shares in a public or private company; 
• the provision of life insurance policies and superannuation benefits. For example, life 
assurance policies, retirement annuity fund and pension fund policies or disability 
policies. The management of a superannuation scheme is, however, standard rated;77F  
• the buying or selling of derivatives and options. For example, options, futures and 
interest-rate swaps; and 
• the buying and selling of cryptocurrency (this excludes other value-added or fee-based 
services associated with cryptocurrency transactions such as exchange services or 
digital wallet management services).  
All fees, commissions, merchant’s discount and similar fee -based charges relating to certain 
financial services, are subject to VAT. For example, a credit agreement may provide for the 
borrower to pay both interest and fees for the credit provided. In terms of the proviso to 
section 2(1), only the fee will attract VAT, whereas the interest will be regarded as 
consideration for the supply of an exempt financial service.85 
 
85  See for example CSARS v Tourvest Financial Services (Pty) Ltd (Case no 435/2020) [2021] 
ZASCA 61 (25 May 2021).  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 7 
 
 55 
Since financial service providers make both taxable and exempt supplies it will be required to 
apportion any VAT incurred (including notional input tax) on goods or services acquired, which 
cannot be directly attributed wholly for the purposes of consumpti on, use or supply in the 
course of making taxable supplies. See 8.4 for more details. 
The supply of certain financial services to a non -resident, who is not in the Republic at the 
time the service is rendered, may in certain circumstances be subject to VAT at the zero rate 
and not exempt. For example, the interest received in respect of the provision of credit to a 
non-resident is subject to tax at the rate of 0% provided the non-resident is not in the Republic 
at the time that the financial service is rendered to the non-resident.86 
7.6 Associations not for gain and welfare organisations 
An association not for gain may only register if it meets the general registration requirements – 
see 2.7.2 for more information. The supply by an association not for gain of any goods or 
services which it receives as a donation is an exempt supply. The exemption also applies in a 
case where the organisation sells goods which it has manufactured if at least 80% of the value 
of the supply consists of donated goods or services.  
For further information, see the  VAT 414 – Guide for Associations not for Gain and Welfare 
Organisations. 
Example 16 – Supply of donated goods by an association not for gain 
Facts: 
C donates old clothes to a church as well as some off -cuts of wood from C’s carpentry 
business (which will be made into chairs by the organisation). The clothes and chairs will be 
sold at the church’s annual bazaar.  
The church is registered for VAT because, in addition to its religious and fundraising activities, 
it also conducts business activities which involves the purchase and sale of goods where the 
annual value of supplies exceeds the compulsory VAT registration threshold of R1 million.  
Result: 
The VAT implications of the supplies made at the annual church bazaar are as follows: 
  Even though the church is registered for VAT, the sale of the clothes by the church will 
be an exempt supply. Therefore, no input tax may be deducted in making these 
supplies. 
  The sale of the manufactured chairs is also exempt if at least 80% of the value of the 
materials used in making the chairs consists of donated goods and services. Once 
again, no input tax may be deducted in respect of making or selling the chairs. 
However, if the value of the wood constituted 7 0% of the value and the other 30% of 
the value is made up of the cost of glue, nails, paint, fabric, rubber stoppers, transport 
and other taxable inputs, which were not donated to the church, the supply would be 
taxable at the standard rate (as the church is a vendor). In such a case, input tax could 
be deducted on the goods or services from vendors which were acquired in order to 
manufacture and sell the chairs, but not on the wood which was received as a donation. 
 
86 See section  11(2)(l) and Master Currency (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner for South African Revenue 
Service 2014 (6) SA 66 (SCA). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 7 
 
 56 
 
  Any other goods which the church purchased for sale at the bazaar would be taxable 
at the standard rate, and any VAT incurred on the purchase of those goods or services 
may be deducted as input tax. 
  A portion of the VAT incurred may be deducted, based on an approved apportionment 
method, when goods or services are acquired to make both taxable and exempt 
supplies at the bazaar. 
  The activities associated with the church’s religious activities for example, efforts to 
promote the faith and holding church services for its members, are not “enterprise” 
activities. They constitute non -taxable supplies made for no consideration and are 
outside the scope of VAT.87
 
7.7 Out-of-scope supplies 
Supplies that do not fall within the exemptions listed and that are generally outside the scope 
of VAT are referred to as “out -of-scope supplies”. There is often a misconception that if a 
supply is not made in the furtherance of an enterprise activity the supply is by default exempt. 
However, supplies of goods or services not specifically exempted under section 12 of the Act,  
are regarded as being out-of-scope supplies and input tax may not be deducted on the VAT 
incurred to make out-of-scope supplies. 
Some examples of out-of-scope supplies are: 
• Goods or services supplied by public authorities that have not been notified to register 
as vendors (government departments and public entities listed in Parts A and C to 
Schedule 3 of the PFMA). 
• The sale of private assets of a vendor, which are not associated with an enterprise, for 
example, where a property developer sells his private residence , the sale  does not 
form part of his enterprise and no VAT must be charged on the sale of the property. 
Instead, the purchaser will have to pay transfer duty on acquisition of the property, 
subject to any exemptions or exceptions which may be applicable.  
• Certain supplies that are not made for a consideration (see IN 70).  
  
 
 
  
 
87 See KCM v Commissioner South African Revenue Services  [2009] ZATC 2 and Interpretation 
Note 70 “Supplies made for No Consideration”. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 57 
Chapter 8  
Input tax and other deductions 
8.1 What will qualify as input tax or a deduction? 
Generally, the VAT charged by a vendor to another vendor on any goods or services acquired 
for the business will qualify as input tax in the hands of the recipient vendor. It does not matter 
if the goods or services are acquired for the purposes of consumption or use by the business 
itself, or for the purposes of making a supply to another person. It is important that input tax is 
only deducted insofar as the supplies are used for the purposes of making taxable supplies in 
the course or furtherance of the enterprise. 
No VAT may be deducted when goods or services are acquired for private purposes, exempt 
supplies or other non-taxable purposes. See Chapter 7 for examples of exempt supplies. 
To qualify as input tax, three requirements must be met, namely – 
(a) The goods or services supplied must be acquired by the vendor wholly or partly for 
consumption, use or supply in the course of making taxable supplies. 
(b) VAT at the standard rate must have been charged on the taxable supply (except in the 
case of “second-hand goods,”88 or goods repossessed or surrendered under an ICA 
which have been acquired under a non-taxable supply). 
(c) The appropriate documentation must be held by the vendor, as follows: 
(i) Standard-rated supplies – a valid tax invoice, debit note or credit note or other 
prescribed documentation. Should such tax invoice, debit note or credit note 
be issued in the name of the vendor’s agent, the vendor must be in possession 
of a statement received from such agent containing certain particulars.89 
(ii) Non-taxable supply of s econd-hand goods – records must be maintained by 
the vendor deducting the input tax as per form VAT264 and section 20(8). 
(iii) Goods repossessed or surrendered under an ICA – records must be 
maintained by the vendor deducting the input tax as per section 20(8A) and the 
further particulars prescribed in BGR 63.  
(iv) Importation of goods – a bill of entry  or other prescribed customs 
documentation90 which may be required in the circumstances , including the 
receipt for the payment of the VAT to Customs, that is, the receipt number on 
eFiling. Should such bill of entry or other prescribed documentation be held by 
the vendor’s agent, the vendor must be in possession of a statement received 
from such agent containing, among other particulars, the receipt number for the 
payment of the VAT on importation issued on eFiling.91 
(v) Tax charged in respect of locally manufactured goods where the excise duty or 
environmental levy has not been included in the selling price – prescribed 
Customs documentation, and proof that the VAT has been paid to Customs. 
 
88 Refers to “second-hand goods” as defined in section 1(1). 
89 Sections 54(3)(a) and 16(2)(e). See 13.6.4 for the relevant particulars. 
90 See Chapter 12 for documents that must be retained. 
91 Sections 54(3)(b) and 16(2)(dA). See 12.2.2 for more details on the relevant particulars. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 58 
Remember: 
• In the case of “second -hand goods”, the amount of input tax  that is deductible is the 
tax fraction of the payment made towards the purchase price. 
• The VAT Act was amended with effect from 1  April 2023, to clarify that the VAT264 
declaration is only required for deducting input tax in respect of “second-hand goods”. 
New requirements apply for deducting input tax in respect of goods repossessed or 
surrendered under an ICA  has been prescribed under the new section  (20)(8A). 
See 13.7.2. 
The following are typical examples of expenses incurred for the purpose of making taxable 
supplies on which input tax may be deducted by a vendor: 
• Trading stock and raw materials 
• Manufacturing overheads 
• Water, electricity and telephone charges 
• Administrative overheads such as audit and accounting fees 
• Marketing and advertising expenditure 
• Movable assets such as office furniture, computer equipment and fixed property 
• Delivery vehicles 
• Rental charges for office space or for factory premises 
• Production machinery and maintenance expenses  
• Professional fees such as those charged by architects and engineers 
• Fees charged by VAT registered consultants and other independent contractors (but 
not salaries and wages of employees) 
Apart from input tax, there are other specified deductions which a vendor is allowed to make 
in the calculation of its VAT liability or refund for a tax period.92 You need to be in possession 
of documentary proof which is prescribed by the Commissioner in order to substantiate such 
specified deductions.93 Examples are deductions in respect of – 
• indemnity payments made to insured’s by the insurer under a contract of insurance; 
• amounts paid as a prize or winnings under betting transactions; or 
• change in use adjustments (See Chapter 9). 
 
92 Refers to deductions set out in section 16(3)(c) to (o). 
93 Section 16(2)(f). The prescribed documentation is set out in Interpretation Note 92 “Documentary 
Proof Prescribed by the Commissioner”.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 59 
A vendor may, under section 16(2)(g), apply for a VAT ruling94 requesting the Commissioner 
to confirm that alternative documentary proof held by the vendor may be used to substantiate 
a deduction, should the vendor be unable to obtain the prescribed documentation under 
section 16(2)(a) to (f).95 The request for the ruling must be made at least two months before 
the expiry of the 5-year period within which a deduction is allowed to be made by the vendor 
(see 8.3.5 in this regard). SARS will only issue the ruling if satisfied that – 
• the vendor has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the prescribed documentary  
evidence and is now applying for the ruling as a last resort to resolve the issue; 
• the inability of the vendor to obtain and maintain the prescribed documentation was 
due to circumstances beyond that vendor’s control; and 
• no other provision of the VAT Act allows for a deduction based on the particular 
document in the vendor’s possession. 
8.2 How is a deduction made? 
Input tax and other deductions are declared  in Part B of the VAT201 return for the particular 
tax period. All input tax deductions (including second -hand goods acquired) and other 
deductions will be completed in fields 14, 14A, 15, 15A, 16, 17 and 18 of the VAT201 return. 
Fields 14 and 14A of the return are where you will deduct the input tax relating to  any local 
capital purchases and imported capital goods, respectively. Fields 15 and 15A must be 
completed in respect of a deduction of any other goods or services used or consumed in the 
business in the course of making taxable supplies (including stock) and non -capital goods 
imported, respectively. Fields 16, 17 and 18 will be completed for input tax and other specified 
deductions for example, bad debts and adjustments. See also Chapter 10. 
Your deductions are set -off against your output tax liability (completed in Part A) on the 
VAT201 return. The difference between these two amounts can either give rise to a refund, or 
a liability for that tax period. If your deductions exceed the total out put tax liability on the 
VAT201 return (and any other amounts that you may owe SARS for past tax periods or other 
taxes), or if you have no output tax for that particular tax period, the excess will be refunded 
to you. Make sure that SARS has your correct banking details so that any refunds due to you 
can be paid safely and conveniently into your account without any unnecessary delays. 
 
94 See Chapter 15 for more information on how to apply for a VAT ruling. In a case where a company 
undergoes a name change, the tax invoice in the old name is not invalidated as a result of that 
change. The recipient vendor in that case should not apply for a ruling under section 16(2)( g), but 
instead, maintain the documentary proof of the name change from the Companies and Intellectual 
Property Commission. SARS should be informed immediately by way of a change in registered 
particulars and all suppliers should be informed to correct thei r records as soon as possible. This 
will ensure that all future tax invoices can be issued in the correct (new) company name and will 
reduce the risk of having input tax denied by SARS.

8.3 When and what to deduct 
8.3.1 General 
The following factors generally have an effect on the amount of input tax and/or other specified 
deductions you are entitled to, as well as when you may make such a deduction: 
• The accounting basis on which you are registered, that is  whether you are on the 
invoice or payments basis, and any special rules applicable to the particular supply 
(see Chapter 4 for details). 
• Whether the specific inputs are disallowed or are limited in any way (see 8.5 below). 
• The extent to which the goods or services acquired will be used for taxable purposes 
(see 8.4 below in this regard). 
The correct tax period in which to make your input tax deduction is determined by the 
accounting basis, that is, whether you account for VAT on an invoice or payment s basis as 
discussed in Chapter 4. The special provisions for other specified deductions provide 
guidance on when each specified deduction may be made. 
Under the invoice basis of accounting you may deduct an amount of input tax in the tax period 
in which the supply has been made to you. Under the payments basis, the vendor may only 
deduct input tax to the extent of actual payment made during the tax period towards the 
purchase price of the goods or services acquired. See Chapter 5 for time of supply rules in 
order to determine when a supply has been made to you. 
8.3.2 Importation of goods 
With effect  from 1 April 2015, VAT levied on the  importation of goods may be deducted 
provided the goods have been released by Customs. Therefore, the input tax deduction may 
only be made from the tax period in which the custom release notification is issued, which can 
be confirmed by the date on such notification. See 12.2.2 for the documentary proof required 
to be held in order to substantiate the input tax deduction. 
8.3.3 Fixed property 
VAT incurred on the acquisition of fixed property is deductible to the extent that payment 
towards the purchase price has been made during the tax period and the time of supply has 
been triggered . For further information, see VAT 409 – Guide for Fixed Property and

8.3.4 Supplies of valuable metal under the DRC 
Input tax may only be deducted in respect of the supply of valuable metal, if the recipient has 
accounted for and paid the VAT in respect of such supply on a VAT201 return. If the 
documents are in order, the recipient may deduct the input tax in the same tax period in which 
the output tax is declared.  
The declaration and payment of the VAT on the supply of valuable metal will form part of the 
recipient vendor’s normal calculation of the tax payable or refundable on the VAT201 return. 
The VAT component paid on any supplies of valuable metal acquired that are subject to the 
domestic reverse charge under the DRC Regulat ions must be accounted for in Field  12 of 
VAT201 return. Any input tax on such acquisitions of valuable metal must be shown in Field 18 
of the VAT201 return. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 61 
The recipient vendor must also issue a statement containing the prescribed details96 in writing 
to the vendor that supplied the valuable metal within 21 days from the end of the calendar 
month during which the VAT on the supply of valuable metal has been accounted and paid for 
by the recipient vendor. 
8.3.5 Second-hand goods 
The VAT Act allows vendors under certain circumstances to deduct input tax on second-hand 
goods acquired from non-vendors where no VAT is actually payable to the supplier, or where 
the goods are supplied by a vendor but do  not form part of the vendor’s enterprise . This is 
known as a notional or deemed input tax deduction. 
The conditions under which a notional input tax deduction may be made are as follows: 
• The goods must be “second-hand goods” as defined in section 1(1) 
• The supply may not be a taxable supply (for example, the goods are purchased from 
a non-vendor) 
• The supplier must be a South African resident and the goods supplied must be situated 
in RSA 
• The purchaser must have made payment for the supply, or at least made part payment 
as a notional input tax deduction is only allowed to the extent that payment has been 
made 
• The goods must be acquired by the vendor wholly or partly for consumption, use or 
supply in the course of making taxable supplies 
• The vendor must be in possession of the prescribed records as per section 20(8). 
(See Chapter 13 for more details on the prescribed records) 
• The notional input tax deduction on gold and goods containing gold may be allowed 
provided that the goods are sold in the same or substantially the same state as when 
the goods were acquired.97 
The notional input tax is calculated by multiplying the tax fraction by the lesser of the 
consideration paid or the OMV. Where the OMV is less than the consideration paid, the OMV 
will be used to calculate the notional input tax deduction. 
Example 1 7 – Limitation of notional input tax to the extent of payment of the 
consideration 
Facts: 
A second-hand goods dealer buys a used fridge from a non -vendor for R600 for resale. He 
pays the person R400 immediately and the balance of R200 in the next tax period.  
Result: 
Input tax is calculated as follows: R 
Deduct in tax period 1 – R400 × 15 / 115  =  52,17 
Deduct in tax period 2 – R200 × 15 / 115  =  26,09 
 Total  =  78,26

97 See BGR 43 “Deduction of Input Tax in Respect of Second-Hand Gold”. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 62 
In the case of the supply of second-hand goods being “fixed property” which is not subject to 
VAT, the input tax is limited to the transfer duty payable if the property was acquired on or 
before 9 January 2012. 
The input tax in such cases may only be deducted once the time of supply for VAT purposes 
has occurred (that is earlier of the date on which any payment is made or the date on which 
the fixed property is transferred to the recipient vendor by registration in the deeds registry ), 
and only after the transfer duty has actually been paid to SARS.  In the case of second-hand 
goods being “fixed property” acquired after 9  January 2012, the limitation of the input tax 
deduction to transfer duty payable does not apply.  However, the input tax may only be 
deducted if the fixed property is transferred to the recipient vendor by registration in the Deeds 
Registry (where applicable) and to the extent that payment towards the purchase price for the 
property has been made to the seller.98 
8.3.6 Period to make an input tax or other deduction 
As mentioned above, it is very important to ensure that you have the relevant tax invoice, debit 
note, credit note, bill of entry or other prescribed or acceptable documentary proof before 
making a deduction. A deduction is only allowed in the tax period that the relevant prescribed 
or acceptable documentary proof is obtained. Further, to avoid forfeiting your claim, you must 
ensure that the deduction is made in a tax period falling within a period of five years after the 
end of the tax period during which –99 
• a tax invoice for a standard rated supply should have been issued (that is, within 
21 days from the time of supply); 
• imported goods were entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise 
Act; 
• second-hand goods were acquired or goods were repossessed or surrendered in 
terms of an ICA; 
• a vendor  (being the principal)  was provided with a statement envisaged in 
section 54(3) by its agent in respect of the purchase of goods or services or the 
importation of goods on behalf of that vendor. (The statement must include certain 
details regarding the goods or services purchased or the goods imported.); or 
• a vendor first became entitled to such deduction, in any other case. 
If the deduction was not previously permitted in accordance with a practice generally 
prevailing, the deduction is limited to six months before the tax period in which the deduction 
100is made. See 16.3 for more details on “practice generally prevailing”. 
 
98  See also BGR 57 “Whether the Term “Consideration” Includes an Amount of Transfer Duty for the 
Purposes of Calculating a Notional Input Tax Deduction on the Acquisition of Second -Hand Fixed 
Property”. BGR 57 clarifies that the amount of “consideration” paid or payable for the property (being 
the amount upon which the notional input tax deduction is calculated) does not include any transfer 
duty.

8.4 Apportionment 
8.4.1 Introduction 
Generally, the full amount of VAT on goods or services acquired or imported by a vendor for 
the purposes of making taxable supplies may be deducted as input tax. However, where goods 
or services are imported or purchased locally for taxable and other non -taxable purposes 
(mixed purposes), only a portion of the VAT or notional input tax in respect thereof (collectively 
referred to as VAT) may be deducted. Therefore, when goods or services are not acquired 
exclusively for taxable supplies, you will be required to determine the part that relates to 
taxable supplies and deduct input tax only to that extent. 
8.4.2 Direct attribution vs apportionment 
Before attempting to apportion an expense, the first step is to determine if the expense can 
be directly attributed. Direct attribution means that you will be required to attribute the VAT 
expense according to the intended purpose for which the goods or services acquired  will be 
used. 
Direct attribution means that permissible expenses101 are incurred either: 
• Wholly for making taxable supplies, in which case the VAT can be deducted in full; or 
• Wholly for making exempt supplies or other non -taxable purposes, in which case no 
VAT on the expense can be deducted as input tax. 
It is only when an expense has been incurred partly for the purpose of consumption, use or 
supply in the course of making taxable supplies and partly for exempt and other non-taxable 
purposes, that the VAT must be apportioned. Once it is clear that the expense must be 
apportioned, the next step is to calculate the proportion of VAT which may be deducted  as 
input tax. This is referred to as the apportionment ratio and is expressed as a percentage. 
Although there may be a few exceptions, the most common expenses that need to be 
apportioned are the general overheads of the business. 
 
 
101 VAT on certain expenses listed in section  17(2) may not be deducted, even if the expense is 
incurred for purposes of making taxable supplies. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 64 
The diagram below illustrates the concepts of direct attribution and apportionment: 
 
As shown above, where the acquisition of goods or services can be identified as being 
exclusively or wholly for a particular purpose, the VAT on those supplies can either be 
deducted in full (wholly for taxable supplies), or no VAT may be deducted as it does not qualify 
as input tax  (wholly for exempt or other non -taxable purposes). In applying the concept of 
direct attribution, the manner in which expenses are incurred and the actual application of the 
goods or services in the business must be examined. 
This is a relatively simple exercise whe n it concerns a vendor that o nly makes taxable 
supplies, as the goods or services will usually be acquired exclusively for taxable supplies, 
and the VAT may be deducted in full. However, when goods or services are acquired by a 
vendor th at conducts taxable and non -taxable activities  (for example , exempt and non-
enterprise activities), the first step is to determine whether the expense is incurred wholly for 
taxable, exempt or other non-taxable purposes.

The concept of direct attribution is illustrated in Examples 18 to 20 below. 
Example 18 – Direct attribution: Taxable supplies 
Facts: 
ABC Bank buys a building which costs R 3 335 000 (including VAT). The building consists of 
units which are to be rented out to businesses as office space.  
Result: 
Although the bank makes both taxable and exempt supplies, the building was acquired 
exclusively for making taxable supplies ( letting of property as offices). The expense is 
therefore wholly attributable to making taxable supplies  and the bank can deduct the full 
amount of VAT charged as input tax (R3 335 000 × 15 / 115 = R435 000). 
 
Example 19 – Direct attribution: Exempt supplies 
Facts: 
J’s Transport runs a fleet of buses which are used exclusively to provide public passenger 
transport. It imports a new bus for the exclusive purpose of its local passenger transport 
business and pays an amount of R32 000 VAT on the value of the bus on importation. 
Result: 
Since the supply of public passenger transport to fare-paying passengers in a bus is exempt, 
the VAT paid is wholly attributable to making exempt supplies. J’s Transport can therefore not 
deduct any VAT paid on the importation of the bus as input tax. 
 
Example 20 – Direct attribution vs. apportionment 
Facts: 
ABC Municipality rents a two-storey building under a single lease agreement which houses its 
public passenger transport and municipal rates divisions. The divisions occupy the ground 
floor and first floor of the building respectively. The divisions use the same software which has 
been implemented across all of the municipality’s different divisions and it receives a single 
telephone account each month for telephone usage for the building address. The municipality 
does not maintain separate cost accounts for each division. 
What are the VAT implications for ABC Municipality? 
Result: 
The public passenger transport division makes only exempt supplies and the municipal rates 
division makes only taxable supplies. Although the divisions are organised along the lines of 
wholly taxable and wholly non -taxable activities, ABC Municipality has not arranged its 
contracts or implemented accounting methods to specifically allocate costs incurred by each 
division. 
 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 66 
Furthermore – 
  the lease agreement does not provide for separate rental amounts for each division; 
  the cost of the computer software relates to the organisation as a whole; and 
  the account for the use of telephones is not billed to each division separately. 
It follows that ABC Municipality would have to apportion all of its VAT incurred in relation to 
these expenses, since it cannot directly attribute the expenses wholly to taxable or wholly to 
exempt supplies. 
8.4.3 Apportionment methodology 
Once it has been established that the expense cannot be directly attributed wholly to taxable 
purposes or wholly to exempt or other non-taxable purposes, the second level of enquiry is to 
determine the portion of VAT which qualifies as input tax, based on the extent to which the 
intended use is for taxable purposes.  The apportionment ratio must be determined by using 
an approved apportionment method so that only a fair and reasonable proportion of VAT is 
deducted as input tax.102 
The only pre-approved method which may be used to apportion VAT incurred for mixed 
purposes without specific prior written approval from the Commissioner is the  
turnover-based method. This method may be applied in the absence of a specific ruling 
obtained by the vendor to use another method. However, in circumstances where the turnover-
based method is inappropriate because it produces an absurd result, proves impossible to 
use, or does not yield a fair approximation of the extent of taxable application of the 
enterprise’s VAT-inclusive expenses, the vendor must approach SARS to obtain approval to 
use an alternative method which yields a more accurate result.  Should a specific ruling that 
has been granted to the vendor turn out to be inappropriate, at a later stage, the vendor cannot 
make the choice to use the turnover-based method without requesting a further ruling  from 
SARS to that effect. 
In deciding whether the turnover -based method is appropriate, the vendor must apply a 
common-sense approach which would be applied by a reasonable person. The method must 
therefore achieve a “fair and reasonable” result which is a proper reflection of the manner in 
which the vendor’s resources (business inputs) are applied for making taxable and non -
taxable supplies respectively. 
Although the term “fair and reasonable” will usually be perceived as a subjective concept, 
vendors applying the turnover-based method of apportionment should try to be objective and 
consider that the result must be perceived as “fair and reasonable” from the Commissioner’s 
perspective as well. The result must also be capable of being justified as appropriate in the 
vendor’s circumstances. For example, where a company applies a method of apportionment 
and it undergoes a major restructuring, or the nature of the business changes so that the 
extent of taxable and non -taxable supplies are significantly different after that event, the 
vendor is required to approach the Commissioner to confirm whether the current method is 
still appropriate. 
 
102 See section 17(1) and Chapter 7 of the TA Act.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 67 
Alternatively, if it is clear from the outset that the apportionment method will not yield a fair and 
reasonable result after the changes, a ruling should be obtained to apply another method 
which results in a more fair and reasonable proportion of VAT being deducted as input tax in 
the year that the changes occur, and in any subsequent years. 
The apportionment percentage should not be excessive or extreme so that either a 0% or 
100% result is achieved. If an extreme result is achieved, it may be an indication that either 
the formula is inappropriate, or it is not being applied correctly. 
The effective date of application of a change in an approved methodology will be  within the 
year of assessment (where the vendor is a taxpayer) or within 12 months ending on the last 
day of February or the last day of the vendor’s fin ancial year (where the vendor is not a 
taxpayer), during which the application for the aforementioned method was made.103 
For confirmation of this principle and other aspects related to the application of the turnover -
based method of apportionment as set out in BGR 16 104 “Standard Apportionment Method” 
(BGR 16), see the case of Mukuru Africa (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner for the South African 
Revenue Service (Case no 520/2020) [2021] ZASCA 116 (16 September 2021). In particular, 
this case is important with reference to the first note under the “conditions” regarding the 
applicability of that method in a situation where a vendor applies for a ruling for a special 
method of apportionment. The case made it clear that the effective date of the special method 
of apportionment may not be backdated beyond what the law allows, which is to the beginning 
of the financial year in which the ruling application was made.105 
Following on from the diagram under 8.4.2, the second level of enquiry in establishing the 
apportionment percentage is illustrated in the diagram below.

The formula for the turnover-based method is as follows: 
Formula: Turnover-based method of apportionment106 
 
Formula: y =        a      × 100  
    (a + b + c)   1  
 
Where: 
y = the apportionment ratio / percentage; 
a = the value of all taxable supplies (including deemed taxable supplies) made during the period;  
b = the value of all exempt supplies made during the period; and  
c = the sum of any other amounts of income not included in “a” or “b” in the formula, which were received 
or which accrued during the period (whether in respect of a supply or not).  
Notes: 
1. The term “value” excludes any VAT component. 
2. “c” in the formula will typically include items such as dividends and statutory fines (if any). 
3. Exclude from the calculation the value of any capital goods or services supplied, unless supplied 
under a rental agreement / operating lease (that is, not a financial lease or ICA).107 
4. Exclude from the calculation the value of any goods or services supplied where input tax on those 
goods or services was specifically denied. 
5. The apportionment percentage should be rounded off to two decimal places. 
6. Where the formula yields an apportionment ratio/percentage of 95% or more, the full amount of VAT 
incurred on mixed expenses may be deducted (referred to as the de minimis rule).  
Conditions: 
The aforementioned method is subject to the following conditions: 
1. The vendor may only use this method if it is fair and reasonable. Where the method is not fair and 
reasonable or inappropriate, the vendor must apply to SARS to use an alternative method. 
2. Vendors using their previous year’s turnover to determine the current year’s apportionment ratio are 
required to do an adjustment (that is, the difference in the ratio when applying the current and previous 
years’ turnover) within six months after the end of the financial year. 
 
Example 21 – Application of the turnover-based method of apportionment 
Facts: 
ABC Bank buys computer software for R460 000 (including VAT). The bank’s apportionment 
ratio is 60% based on the turnover -based apportionment method. The software is used to 
administer the supplies of all the taxable and exempt divisions of the bank.  
Result: 
The software is therefore used by the bank partly in the course of making taxable supplies and 
partly for making exempt supplies. In this case, 60% of the VAT incurred on the acquisition of 
the computer software (R36 000) may be deducted as input tax. 
Calculation: [(R460 000 × 15 / 115) × 60%] = R60 000 × 60% = R36 000  
 
 
106 The formula is contained in BGR 16 “Standard Apportionment Method”. 
107 Note that this exclusion will only apply where the vendor concerned does not usually supply capital 
items on a regular basis as a normal part of the business, unless such items are supplied under an 
ICA. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 69 
Example 22 – Application of the de minimis rule 
Facts: 
ABC Properties buys computer software for R 460 000 (including VAT). The apportionment 
ratio is determined to be 96% based on the turnover -based method of apportionment. The 
software is used to administer the taxable and exempt supplies in respect of its leasing 
business.  
Result: 
The software is used by ABC properties partly in the course of making taxable supplies and 
partly for making exempt supplies. However, since the apportionment ratio is calculated as 
being 96%, the full amount of VAT may be deducted as input tax. This is be cause the de 
minimis rule (where the ratio is 95% or more) may be applied. As a result, the full amount of 
R56 000 VAT incurred on the acquisition of the computer software may be deducted as input 
tax. 
Calculation: [R460 000 × 15 / 115] × 100% = R60 000. 
The turnover -based method is generally calculated using information extracted from the 
financial statements of the vendor’s business. However, there could be a situation in which 
the financial statements do not specify the information that is required for the purposes of 
calculating the turnover -based method (that is, the income statement reflects an amount of 
income that is made up of both taxable and exempt supplies). Vendors sh ould therefore 
ensure that if this is the case, adequate accounting records are maintained to establish the 
actual value of taxable supplies, exempt supplies and other non-taxable receipts. 
In terms of the VAT Act, a vendor is required to determine the apportionment percentage in 
respect of every tax period. However, in  practice, it is often difficult to accurately determine 
the apportionment percentage according to the turnover-based method in each and every tax 
period as required. Therefore, vendors are allowed  to calculate the estimated percentage 
using the turnover figures from the previous year’s financial statements, and to apply that 
percentage for deducting input tax in each and every individual tax period for the current year. 
An adjustment must then be made for any shortfall or overestimation in the percentage used 
for the calculation, when the audited financial statements for the current financial year are 
available, and the actual percentage can be calculated. It should, however, be noted that this 
is merely a practical administrative arrangement and does not have the effect of altering any 
legal provisions in the VAT Act. For example, it does not extend the five-year period in terms 
of which a deduction of input tax may be made under section 16(3). This adjustment should 
be done within a period of six months after the financial year -end. If the audited financial 
statements have not been completed within that time, an adjustment should be made using 
the year-end trial balance figures. This would be followed by a final adjustment when the 
audited financial statements for that year are eventually finalised. 
For new enterprises with no past financial statements, an estimate based on expected taxable 
turnover according to the enterprise’s business plan or sales/marketing forecasts could be 
used for each and every tax period. As in the situation above, an adjustment would be required 
within six months of the financial year -end to account for any differences between the 
estimated apportionment percentage used, and the actual extent of taxable supplies as 
determined from the audited financial statements.

Company J owns a small double-storey building on the outskirts of a large city. The building 
is used for mixed purposes in that it has 4 shops on the ground floor (taxable supplies) and 2 
large residential apartments on the top floor (exempt supplies).  
Shops are rented for R12 000 each (plus VAT at 15%) and apartments for R8 000 each per 
month (no VAT). There are no separate meters for water and electricity and these expenses 
are paid by Company J in terms of the lease agreements.

Note 5: Annual adjustment  
Assuming that the vendor used an apportionment percentage of 72% during the year for all tax periods 
(based on the 2022 financial statements), the vendor would be entitled to deduct an input tax adjustment 
in field 18 of the VAT201 return for the shortfall of 3% calculated as follows:  
R45 450 (R303 000 x 15%) × 3% = R1 363,50.  
Similarly, had the 2018 financial statements indicated the percentage to be 80%, the vendor would be 
required to make the following output tax adjustment in field 12 of the VAT201:  
R45 450 (R303 000 x 15%) × 5% = R2 272,50. 
The adjustment in both scenarios above must be made within six months of the financial year-end.

8.5 Denial of input tax 
The VAT Act provides that input tax is denied on certain expenses even if the  expenses are 
incurred in the course of conducting an enterprise. These include – 
• goods or services acquired for purposes of entertainment (subject to certain exceptions 
mentioned in 8.5.1); 
• membership fees or subscriptions of clubs, associations or societies of a sporting, 
social or recreational nature;  
• the acquisition of a motor car by a vendor (subject to exceptions for motor car dealers 
and car rental enterprises mentioned in 8.5.3); and 
• goods or services acquired by medical schemes or benefit funds for the purposes of 
health insurance or benefit cover. 
The specific details as well as the exceptions are detailed below under separate headings. 
8.5.1 Entertainment 
Common examples of entertainment expenses are – 
• food and other ingredients purchased in order to provide meals to staff, clients and 
business associates. This includes year-end lunches and parties, hiring of venues for 
those functions, as well as expenses incurred for the provision of free meals at 
workplace canteens or complimentary staff refreshments (for example, tea, coffee and 
other beverages or snacks provided to staff); 
• business lunches, golf days, or other entertainment of customers and clients in 
restaurants, theatres, night clubs or sporting events;  
• goods or services acquired for providing employees with free meals. This also applies 
to goods or services  acquired for providing employees with subsidised meals if the 
direct and indirect costs of providing those benefits and facilities are not covered by 
the price charged. For  example, catering services, furniture, equipment and utensils 
used in kitchens, canteens and dining rooms; 
• beverages, meals, entertainment shows, amusements or other hospitality supplied to 
customers and clients at product launches and promotional events; and 
• capital goods such as hospitality boxes, holiday houses, yachts and private aircraft. 
Exceptions: 
In the following circumstances, input tax relating to entertainment expenses incurred may be 
deducted: 
• Vendors in the business of supplying entertainment – the entertainment must be 
supplied at a charge that at least covers all the costs of supplying the entertainment or 
such charge must be equal to the OMV of the entertainment . However, the 
entertainment does not have to be supplied at a charge that covers such costs or 
equates to such OMV in respect of genuine client promotions where the entertainment 
is of the same sort as that normally provided for a charge (for example, two milkshakes 
for the price of one). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 73 
• Personal subsistence – only if the entertainment is acquired by the vendor and relates 
to a meal, refreshment or accommodation consumed or enjoyed by the vendor or the 
vendor’s employee in carrying out the vendor’s business, in respect  of any night that 
the vendor or employee must be away on business from his  or her normal place of 
work and residence. No input tax credit is allowed in respect of an allowance paid to 
the employee to cover such expenses. 
• Meals or refreshments supplied by organisers of seminars and similar events where 
the cost is included in the price of the ticket or entrance fee. 
• Entertainment provided by o perators of taxable passenger transport services to 
passengers or crew during the journey in which such entertainment is supplied as part 
of the taxable transport service to passengers, or as part of the subsistence of crew. 
• Sport or recreational facilities provided by municipalities. 
• Expenses incurred by a welfare organisation in carrying on “welfare activities”. 
• Expenses incurred by an FDFP VAT branch for purposes of a project administered 
under an international donor funding agreement . See Chapter 2  and the VAT 
Reference Guide for Foreign Donor Funded Projects for more details on FDFPs. 
• Entertainment which is awarded as a prize in consequence of a bet received by the 
vendor on the outcome of a race or some other unpredictable event. 
• Meals and refreshments provided to the crew on board a ship or vessel by a vendor 
that operate such ship or vessel at sea in the course of making taxable supplies ( for 
example, fishing vessels, oil rigs). 
See the VAT 411 – Guide for Entertainment, Accommodation and Catering which deals with 
this topic in detail. 
8.5.2 Club subscriptions of a recreational nature 
Input tax may not be deducted on VAT paid in respect of any membership fees to sporting, 
recreational and private clubs. For example, membership of a country club, soccer supporters 
club, amateur boxing club, holiday club, tea club, and stokvel savings club. However, the VAT 
incurred on subscriptions to magazines and trade journals which are related in a direct manner 
to the nature of the enterprise carried on by the vendor may be deducted as input tax. The 
VAT on any fees or subscriptions to professional organisations paid by a vendor on behalf of 
its employees may not be deducted as input tax. 
8.5.3 Motor cars 
The term “motor car” is defined in the VAT Act and includes vehicles which – 
• have three or more wheels; 
• are normally used on public roads; and 
• are constructed or converted mainly or wholly for carrying passengers. 
As a general rule, a n input tax deduction may not be made by a vendor if a vehicle falling 
within the definition of a “motor car” is acquired, even if it is used in the course of making 
taxable supplies and regardless of the mode of acquisition. (For example, the motor car could 
be acquired by way of outright purchase, importation, ICA, operating rental agreement or 
casual hire.) It is only in the case of suppliers of motor cars (for example motor car dealers or 
car rental enterprises) that the deduction of input tax is allowed, as it is the nature of these 
enterprises to supply motor cars on a continuous or regular basis. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 74 
The subsequent sale by the vendor of a motor car in respect of which an input tax was denied 
is not seen as a supply in the course or furtherance of an enterprise, 108 and therefore the 
vendor is not required to account for output tax. This compensates for the disallowance of the 
input tax deduction on the acquisition of a “motor car”. 
Input tax may be deducted on the acquisition  of any vehicle which does not fall within the 
definition of a “motor car”, provided that it is used for taxable supplies. 
The term “motor car” includes the following vehicles (that is, input tax will generally be denied): 
• Double cab bakkies (LDVs) 
• Ordinary sedan type passenger vehicles 
• Station wagons 
• Minibuses 
• Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) 
The term “motor car” excludes the following vehicles: 
• Goods transportation trucks 
• Single cab light and heavy delivery vehicles 
• Motor-cycles 
• Caravans  
• Ambulances, game viewing vehicles and hearses 
• Vehicles capable of accommodating more than 16 persons (for example, a bus) 
• Vehicles with an unladen mass of 3 500 kg or more 
• Special purpose vehicles constructed for purposes other than the carrying of 
passengers 
• Equipment such as bulldozers, graders, hysters, harvesters and tractors 
Hearses and game viewing vehicles are specifically excluded from the definition of “motor 
car”, as these vehicles are generally not used for private purposes, but are applied exclusively 
in a particular type of business (that is, game viewing vehicles for game viewing, and hearses 
for the transport of deceased persons). Input tax on the acquisition of hearses and game 
viewing vehicles may be deducted where the vehicle is used exclusively for making taxable 
supplies. A vendor is also entitled to an input tax deduction on the acquisition of a motor car 
if it is acquired so that it can be permanently converted into a game viewing vehicle or hearse 
if that type of vehicle is required for use in the enterprise . (For example, an enterprise that 
supplies funeral or game viewing services.) In such cases the vendor will be liable for output 
tax on the subsequent supply (sale) of the vehicle. 
The VAT incurred on repairs, maintenance and the general running costs of a motor car such 
as insurance, tyres, engine oil and servicing may, however, be deducted as input tax if the 
vehicle is used exclusively in the course of making taxable supplies. Thi s could also include 
modification and installation costs incurred after the acquisition of the motor car (for example, 
canopy modification or installation of a built -in toolbox for a bakkie).  However, VAT incurred 
on modifications made before the supply of the motor car cannot be deducted by the purchaser 
 
108 Section 8(14)(a). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 8 
 
 75 
as input tax if it forms part of the motor car as supplied. See Interpretation Note 82 “Input Tax 
on Motor Cars” for more information. 
8.6 Petty cash payments 
Vendors are not obliged to obtain tax invoices for purchases not exceeding R50. These are 
usually expenses which are paid from petty cash for small items such as postage stamps, 
stationery, parking. Even though it is often the case that no tax invoice is r equired for petty 
cash purposes, you will need to keep the till slip, cash slip or sales docket with details of the 
purchase in a petty cash book or similar record in order to deduct the input tax. Make sure that 
the receipt indicates the amount of VAT charged, or alternatively, a statement that the amount 
charged includes VAT at the standard rate, otherwise any deduction in this regard will be 
disallowed. 
8.7 Pre-incorporation expenses 
VAT on expenses incurred by a person in connection with the incorporation of a company 
before the entity can legally be viewed as having come into existence, that is, a company 
which is not yet registered with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission 
(CIPC),109 may in certain instances be deducted by the said company. 
A company that reimburses a person for the costs and purchases incurred b efore it was 
formed is deemed to be the recipient of the goods or services and to have paid any VAT 
component. Accordingly the company can deduct that VAT as input tax in the tax period during 
which the reimbursement is made. 
This will only be allowed if the person – 
• was reimbursed by the company for the whole amount paid; and 
• acquired the goods or services for the purpose of an enterprise to be carried on by the 
company and has not used the goods or services for any other purpose. 
Input tax may not be deducted by the company where – 
• the supply of the goods or services by the person to the company is a taxable supply, 
or is a supply of second-hand goods (not being a taxable supply); 
• the goods or services were acquired more than six months before the date of 
incorporation; or 
• the company does not hold sufficient records.

Chapter 9  
Adjustments 
9.1 Introduction 
This chapter identifies those situations in which a vendor will be required to make adjustments 
to input tax or output tax. It explains when the adjustments should be made by the vendor and 
what the amounts of the adjustments should be. 
Adjustments to input tax  or output tax will arise in respect of taxable supplies for example, 
where – 
• an irrecoverable debt is written off by a vendor; 
• a debit or credit note is issued or received by a vendor; 
• early payment of an account gives rise to a prompt settlement discount;  
• goods received by the customer are returned to the supplier; and 
• a change in the extent of taxable use or application of goods or services occurs. 
9.2 Irrecoverable debts 
A vendor who accounts for VAT on the invoice basis may deduct input tax in respect of debts 
which have become irrecoverable .110 The pre -requisites for making a deduction on 
irrecoverable debts is that firstly there must have been a taxable supply for a consideration in 
money. Secondly, the vendor must have already accounted for the supply in a VAT return. 
The adjustment is calculated by applying the tax fraction  which applied at the time of supply  
to the amount actually written off. In a case where the vendor subsequently receives payment 
in respect of a debt written off as irrecoverable, the vendor must account for output tax on that 
payment in the tax period in which it is received. 
A vendor may not make an input tax deduction in respect of a debt which has – 
• become irrecoverable under an ICA if the goods supplied in terms of that agreement 
have been repossessed by or surrendered to the vendor; 
• become irrecoverable if the vendor accounts for tax on the payments basis, except to 
the extent that the vendor was required to account for output tax on the invoice basis 
(that is in the case of supplies made for a consideration of R100  000 or more)111 and 
a portion thereof has become irrecoverable; 
• become irrecoverable in respect of a taxable supply of goods or services to another 
vendor if the vendor and the recipient vendor are wholly-owned members of the same 
“group of companies ”112 for income tax purposes, for as long both the vendors are 
wholly-owned members of the same “group of companies”; 
• been transferred at face value to another person on a non-recourse basis. Should the 
debt be transferred on a recourse basis, the vendor may deduct input tax in respect of 
the amount of debt transferred back to the vendor to the extent of  the amount which 
has become irrecoverable; and 
 
110 Section 22. 
111 See 4.5.3 for more details. 
112 Defined in section 1(1) of the Income Tax Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 77 
• become irrecoverable on the supply of valuable metal.113  
A vendor must account for output tax to the extent that the purchase price for the goods or 
services has not yet been paid after  12 months from the end of the tax period in which such 
deduction was made. However, if the purchase price or a part thereof is only payable later 
under an agreement in writing, then the 12-month period will start running from the end of the 
month in which payment should have been made under that agreement.  
In the case of a vendor that has been sequestrated, declared insolvent, enter ed into an 
arrangement under section 155 of the Companies Act114 or cease to be a vendor  within 12 
months after the expiry of the tax period in which such deduction was made, the output tax 
adjustment must be made at the time of the occurrence of such sequestration, declaration of 
insolvency or arrangement or immediately before ceasing to be a vendor . The adjustment is 
calculated by multiplying the outstanding taxable amount by the tax fraction that applied at the 
time the input tax deduction was originally made.  
The output tax adjustment does not apply if – 
• the goods or services were acquired from a nother vendor that is a wholly-owned 
member of the same “group of companies” for income tax purposes as the acquiring 
vendor, for as long as both the vendors are wholly-owned members of the same “group 
of companies”; and 
• such other vendor has not made an input tax deduction for an irrecoverable debt in 
respect of the outstanding amount. 
A vendor who has made the output tax adjustment referred to above, may make an input tax 
deduction to the extent that any portion of the purchase price is paid at a later stage . The 
deduction is calculated based on the tax fraction applicable at the time the initial input tax 
deduction was made. 
9.3 Debit- and credit notes 
The circumstances in which debit- and credit notes are required to be issued are dealt with in 
Chapter 13. Credit notes must be issued by a supplier if a tax invoice was issued  for the 
supply showing an incorrect amount of tax charged, as a result of specified events (for 
example, when faulty goods are returned to a supplier). A vendor that issues a credit note is 
required to make an adjustment either to input tax or output tax. The vendor receiving a credit 
note must make an adjustment to output tax. These adjustments must be accounted for in the 
VAT return for the tax period in which the decrease in consideration occurs, that is, in the tax 
period in which the credit note is issued. 
A vendor that issues a debit note is required to make an adjustment to output tax. The vendor 
receiving a debit note must make an adjustment to input tax. These adjustments must be 
accounted for in the VAT return for the tax period in which the increase in consideration occurs, 
that is, in the tax period in which the debit note is issued by the vendor. 
 
113 Regulation 2(d) of the DRC Regulations 
114 Act 71 of 2000. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 78 
Remember that the rules discussed above apply to vendors in accordance with the principles 
upon which they account for VAT. For example, a vendor who is registered on the payments 
basis will only make the necessary adjustments when payment in respect of the debit or credit 
note is made or received, whereas vendors on the invoice basis account for the debit or credit 
note upon the issue or receipt of that document. 
9.4 Prompt settlement discounts 
Should the terms of a prompt settlement discount be stated on a tax invoice, and the conditions 
relating to the discount are only met in a subsequent tax period, the supplier must declare 
output tax on the full consideration excluding the discount. It is not necessary for the vendor 
to issue a credit note in this regard.  An input tax adjustment may then be claimed in field 18 
of the VAT return for the tax period during which the conditions relating to the discount have 
been met. Alternatively, the vendor may reduce the output tax attributable for th at tax period 
with the amount of the discount. 
Similarly, the vendor receiving the settlement discount must account for output tax in field 12 
of the VAT201 return, or reduce the total amount of input tax deducted in the VAT return for 
the tax period in which the settlement discount is allowed. 
9.5 Rounding differences  
It has become common practice for vendors to round the total amount due on the sale of 
goods or services to the nearest circulated coin when returning change for cash transactions 
(rounding difference). In these instances the tax invoice reflects the total due with the VAT 
calculated thereon and the adjusted amount after the rounding difference is taken into account. 
The effect is that the supplier has charged a lesser consideration for goods or services than 
the advertised amount and a credit note should be issued. However, BGR 65 has been 
published in which the Commissioner directs that the supplier is not required to issue a credit 
note, subject to the certain conditions. To reduce over-declaration of output tax on standard-
rated supplies, the supplier may make an adjustment to the output tax attributable for that tax 
period or deduct input tax and the supplier must retain the relevant records to substantiate the 
adjustment. One of the conditions contained in the BGR is that the tax invoice must clearly 
indicate that input tax can only be deducted on the adjusted amount in the case of a cash 
transaction. See BGR 65 for more information.  
9.6 Change in use or application 
9.6.1 General 
A vendor must make an adjustment to output or input tax (as the case may be), if the extent 
to which capital goods or services used by the vendor to make taxable supplies increases or 
decreases, or goods or services are applied wholly for a different to the intended purpose 
when acquired, manufactured, assembled, constructed or produced. This includes stock items 
or capital assets taken from the business for own use, or for exempt or other non -taxable 
purposes. 
The term “adjusted cost” used in sections 1(1), 16(3)(h), 18(2), (4) and (5) is for the purposes 
of calculating certain input and output tax adjustments required by, or allowed to, a vendor on 
any change of taxable use of assets. The effect is that any costs incurred in acquiring the 
assets which are not VAT inclusive (or deemed to in clude VAT) are excluded in the formula 
used to calculate the adjustment. Examples include finance charges (exempt) or labour 
charges by a non -vendor (no VAT chargeable), and sa lary and wages incurred in the 
manufacture, assembly, construction or production of those goods or services. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 79 
An adjustment to output tax will be required where – 
• goods or services acquired for making taxable supplies are subsequently applied 
wholly for private, exempt or other non-taxable purposes; or 
• there is a decrease of more than 10% in the extent of taxable use or application by the 
vendor of capital goods or services which have an adjusted cost of R40 000 or more. 
• an adjustment to input tax may be permitted where – 
➢ goods or services applied wholly or partly for exempt or private purposes are 
subsequently applied wholly or partly for making taxable supplies; or 
➢ there is an increase of more than 10% in the extent of taxable use or application 
by the vendor of the capital goods or services concerned. 
9.6.2 Change in use from taxable to non-taxable purposes 
If you bought or imported any goods or services (including capital goods or services) for your 
business and deducted input tax, and later, applied the goods or services for your own use, 
for exempt supplies, or for other non-taxable purposes (that is wholly for another purpose),115 
you will have to pay output tax on the OMV of those goods or services. The adjustment must 
be made at the time that the goods or services are applied wholly for non -taxable purposes. 
An output tax adjustment must also be made if you donate any stock or other enterprise assets 
on which input tax was previously deducted if you do not receive anything in return.  
Example 24 – Change in use from taxable to private purposes 
Facts: 
H practices as a chartered accountant, and is registered for VAT under the Category B tax 
period. H bought a computer for the business in January 2016 for R5 700 (including VAT @ 
14%) under a cash sale. H derives all income from making taxable supplies and accordingly 
deducted input tax of R700 in the February 2016 VAT return.  
In February 2019, H decides to upgrade the office computer and takes the computer home for 
use by H’s children. The market value of the computer as at February 201 9 is R2 300. Note 
that the time of supply for the adjustment is after the VAT rate increase from 14% to 15% on 
1 April 2018, therefore the tax fraction 15/115 must be used to calculate VAT on the 
adjustment. 
Result: 
H must now account for output tax of R300 (R2 300 × 15 / 115) in field 12 of the February 2019 
VAT return. 
Property developers in particular have experienced difficulty in complying with this provision 
over the years as they are sometimes unable to sell certain of the residential properties 
developed in difficult economic times. As a result, there is often a te ndency to let these 
properties out temporarily as dwellings whil st continuing to market the properties for sale. 
Immediately upon letting the properties as dwellings, the property developers will be making 
exempt supplies (albeit temporarily) and will be required to account for output tax on the OMV 
of the properties concerned at the time when the change of use occurs. 
 
115 Section 18(1). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 80 
Section 18B was introduced with effect from 10 January 2012 to provide temporary relief for 
property developers when they temporarily change the use of properties held as stock for 
resale (taxable supplies) by letting them as dwellings (exempt supplies) to tenants. The relief 
was in the form of a suspension of the liability to declare output tax on the change in use 
adjustment in certain instances when trading stock in the form of newly developed dwellings 
were temporarily let to tenants (and therefore applied for exempt purposes) whilst being 
marketed for sale. Developers that experience d such difficulties were therefore allowed to 
temporarily let those properties during the relief period which commenced on 10 January 2012 
and ceased on 1 January 2018. 
Section 18B was a temporary measure with a limited lifespan, but a more permanent relief 
mechanism in the form of section 18D (together with associated provisions sections   9(13), 
10(29) and 16(3)(o)) has now been introduced  to deal with temporary letting . The terms 
“developer” and “temporarily applied” have also been defined in section 18D.  
For a detailed explanation on the background to section  18D and the similarities and 
differences between sections  18B and 18D, see Binding General Ruling 64 “Temporary 
Application of New Dwellings for Exempt Supplies Simultaneously held by Developers for 
Taxable Purposes” (BGR 64). 
Section 18D applies when developed dwelling units , held for sale by a developer ,116 are 
“temporarily applied” as defined ,117 as residential accommodation (exempt supplies) for the 
first time on or after 1  April 2022. The developer must make an output tax adjustment and 
declare output tax on the adjusted cost instead of the open market value ( OMV) as would 
normally be the case under section 18(1) before these amendments.118 The time of supply for 
the adjustment is the earlier of the date that the agreement for the letting and hiring of the 
accommodation in a dwelling comes into effect or date on which the dwelling is occupied. 
If the dwelling is sold during the period that it is temporary applied for exempt supplies , the 
sale will be  a taxable supply under section  7(1)(a). The developer may make an input tax 
deduction equal to the output tax that was previously declared when the temporary letting 
commenced.119 The developer will similarly be entitled to deduct input tax upon expiry of the 
12-month period (or lesser period if the temporary letting ceases completely at an earlier date). 
However, if the letting of the property continues beyond the 12-month period allowed, or there 
is a permanent change in use to exempt supplies (or own use) , section 18D will not apply. 
Instead section 18(1) will apply120 and the developer must then make an output tax adjustment 
based on the OMV of the fixed property .121 However, there is an exception to cater for the 
delay in transferring the property. From 1 April 2024, section 18(1) will not apply if a written 
sale agreement is concluded during the temporary letting period of 12 months and the transfer 
of the property occurs after the  12 months expires. Instead the sale will be a taxable supply 
under section 7(1)(a), and the developer must account for output tax on the date of registration 
 
116  See definition of “developer” under section 18D(1)(a). 
117  The “temporarily applied” letting period must not exceed a period of 12  months, whether as a fixed 
or continuous period, or in aggregate. (This rule applies per dwelling unit.)  
118  As section 18B ceased to apply from 1 January 2018, any temporary letting of such newly developed 
dwelling units from the said date until the end of March 2022 would be subject to the adjustment 
under section 18(1) based on the OMV of the property. 
119  Under section 16(3)(o) 
120  Section 18(6)  
121  Section 10(7). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 81 
of transfer of the property in the Deeds Registry or the date on which any payment in respect 
of the consideration for the supply is made, whichever is earlier.122  
Any sale of the property by the developer, after the property has been subjected to an output 
tax adjustment under section 18(1), will not be a taxable supply under section 7(1)(a). Instead, 
the purchaser will be liable to pay transfer duty on the transaction.  
For more information, see the updated VAT 409 – Guide for Fixed Property and Construction 
for Vendors (Issue 3) and BGR 48 “The Temporary Letting of Dwellings by Developers and 
the Expiry of Section 18B”. 
9.6.3 Decrease in extent of taxable use of capital goods or services123 
An adjustment is required to a vendor’s output tax in those circumstances where there is a 
decrease of more than 10% in the extent to which capital goods or services are used or applied 
in the course of making taxable supplies. The adjustment is made on an annual basis. 
No adjustment is applicable where – 
• the adjusted cost is less than R40 000 (excluding VAT); or 
• the vendor is a public authority or constitutional institution and the capital goods or 
services were acquired before 1 April 2005; or 
• the vendor is a municipality and the capital goods or services were acquired before 
1 July 2006; or 
• there is a transfer of any assets, liabilities, rights and obligations as a result of a 
municipal boundary change.124 
Example 25 – Decrease in extent of taxable use of capital goods or services 
Facts: 
C (a registered VAT vendor) owns a double -storey building situated in Cape Town. The 
building is used for mixed purposes, in that it has 8 shops on the ground floor used for making 
taxable supplies and 4 large residential apartments on the first floor used  for making exempt 
supplies. The building has been applied as such from commencement of the business in 
March 2021 when the building was acquired for R1 368  000 (inclusive of VAT). C elected to 
use the standard turnover -based method of apportionment and determined that 80% of the 
building’s income is derived from taxable supplies and 20% from exempt supplies. Therefore, 
in the April 2021 tax period, C deducted input tax of R134 400 (14 / 114 × R1 368 000 × 80%) 
in respect of the building.  
In March 2008, C further purchased a computer system for R 54 000 (inclusive of VAT), 
intended for use in the business. At the time of purchasing the computer system, C still derived 
80% of income from taxable supplies and 20% from exempt supplies. Therefore, in the 
April 2022 tax period, C deducted input tax of R5 305 (14 / 114 × R54 000 × 80%) in respect 
of the computer system acquired. 
 
 
122 Section 9(3)(d). 
123 Section 18(2). 
124  See BGR 39. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 82 
At the end of February 2023, C determines that the nature of her business has changed 
significantly and that the income now comprises of 60% taxable supplies and 40% exempt 
supplies. At the end of that month the adjusted cost and OMV of the building is R1  368 000 
and R2 280 000, respectively, and the computer system has an OMV of R48 000.   
Result: 
Because the decrease in the extent of the taxable use of the capital goods or services exceeds 
10%, C is required to make an adjustment to output tax on the last day of C’s year of 
assessment (February 2023).125 The adjustment required to be made by C to take account of 
the decrease in the extent of taxable use of the building and computer system is determined 
by the formula:  
A × (B – C) 
Where: 
A represents the lesser of: 
 (i) the adjusted cost of the building and computer system, namely, R1 368 000 and 
R54 000, respectively; or 
 (ii) the OMV of the building and computer system, namely, R2 280 000 and R48 000, 
respectively 
B represents the extent of taxable use of the building and computer system at the time of the 
acquisition or in the previous 12-month period, namely, 80% 
C represents the extent of the taxable use of the building and computer system during the 
current 12-month period, namely, 60% 
C’s calculation will be: 
Building  : R1 368 000 × (80% – 60%) = R1 368 000 × 20% = R273 600.  
Computer system : R48 000 × (80% – 60%) = R48 000 × 20%  = R9 600. 
In order to calculate the output tax which must be accounted for, C would apply the tax fraction 
to the amount determined by the formula, for example, 
   15 / 115 × (R273 600 + R9 600) = R36 939. 
C must therefore declare the VAT amount of R36 939 in the tax period ending February 2019 
in the VAT201 return in field 12.  
Note that the time of supply for the adjustment is after the VAT rate increase from 14% to 15% 
on 1  April 2018, therefore the tax fraction  15/115 must be used to calculate VAT on the 
adjustment.  
9.6.4 Change in use from non-taxable to taxable purposes 
A vendor is entitled to make an input tax deduction where goods or services are held for 
exempt, private or other non -taxable purposes and subsequently applied by the vendor for 
consumption, use or supply in the course of making taxable supplies.126 The deduction will not 
apply in respect of any goods or services for which a deduction of input tax is denied. The 
amount of the deduction will depend on the extent of the intended use of the goods or services 
in relation to the total intended use. The vendor may deduct input tax in the tax period in which 
 
125 Section 18(6). 
126 Section 18(4). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 83 
the goods or services are actually used for making taxable supplies. The amount of the 
adjustment is calculated by applying the tax fraction  to the lesser of the adjusted cost 
(including VAT), or the OMV of the relevant goods or services. 
No adjustment is applicable where – 
• the vendor is a public authority or constitutional institution and the goods or services 
were acquired before 1 April 2005; or  
• the vendor is a municipality and the goods or services were acquired before 
1 July 2006. 
Example 26 – Change in use from private (non-taxable) to taxable purposes 
Facts: 
A vendor purchases a single cab bakkie for private purposes on 1  March 2011. The bakkie 
costs R228 000 including VAT at 14% (excluding finance charges and any other charges 
incurred). The vendor then decides to use the bakkie exclusively for the business of delivery 
of goods to customers with effect from 1 March 2023. At the time of introducing the bakkie into 
the business, it had an OMV of R205 200. The vendor is a category B vendor. 
Result: 
The vendor will be entitled to deduct, in addition to other input tax deductions, an amount of: 
15 / 115 × R205 200 = R26 765 in the April 2019 tax period. 
9.6.5 Increase in the extent of taxable use of capital goods or services127 
An input tax adjustment may be made by a vendor in circumstances where there is an increase 
of more than 10% in the extent to which capital goods or services are used or applied in the 
course of making taxable supplies. This adjustment is made on an annual basis. 
No adjustment is applicable where – 
• the adjusted cost is less than R40 000 (excluding VAT); or 
• the vendor is a public authority or constitutional institution and the capital goods or 
services were acquired before 1 April 2005; or  
• the vendor is a municipality and the capital goods or services were acquired before 
1 July 2006. 
Example 27 – Increase in extent of taxable use of capital goods or services 
Facts: 
C (registered VAT vendor) owns a double-storey building situated in Cape Town. The building 
is used for mixed purposes, in that it has 3 shops on the ground floor used to make taxable 
supplies and 4 residential apartments on the first floor used to make exempt supplies.  The 
building has been applied as such from the commencement of the business in March 2007 
when the building was acquired for R1  368 000 (inclusive of VAT). C elected to use the 
standard turnover-based method of apportionment and determined that 60% of the business 
income is derived from taxable supplies and 40% from exempt supplies.  
 
127 Section 18(5). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 84 
 
Therefore, in the April 2007 tax period, C deducted input tax of R100 800 (14  / 114 × 
R1 368 000 × 60%) in respect of the building. 
At the end of February 2023 (being the last day of her year of assessment), C determines that 
the nature of the business has changed significantly and that the income now comprises of 
80% taxable supplies and 20% exempt supplies. At the end of that month the adjusted cost 
and OMV of the building is R1 368 000 and R2 280 000, respectively.  
Result: 
Because the increase in the extent of the taxable use of the capital goods or services exceeds 
10%, C is entitled to an input tax adjustment in the tax period ending on February 20 23. The 
adjustment required to be made by C to take account of the decrease in the extent of taxable 
use of the building is determined by the formula:  
A × B × (C – D) 
Where: 
A represents the tax fraction;  
B represents the lesser of: 
 (i) the adjusted cost of the building namely, R1 368 000; or 
 (ii) the OMV of the building namely, R2 280 000 
C represents the extent of taxable use of the building during the current 12 -month period 
(80%) 
D represents the extent of the taxable use of the building at the time of acquisition or in the 
previous 12-month period (60%) 
C’s calculation will be: 
 Building: 15 / 115 × R1 368 000 × (80% – 60%) = R35 687.  
C may deduct an additional R35 687 in the February 2023 VAT return under field 18. 
Note that the time of supply for the adjustment is after the VAT rate increase from 14% to 15% 
on 1  April 2018, therefore the tax fraction 15/115 must be used to calculate VAT on the 
adjustment. 
9.6.6 Subsequent sale or disposal of goods or services partly applied for taxable 
supplies128 
A vendor that acquires goods or services which are used partly for making taxable supplies 
and thereafter supplies those same goods or services in the course of the enterprise is 
required to account for output tax on the full consideration for the supply. In order to eliminate 
double taxation, the vendor is entitled in these circumstances to deduct the portion of VAT that 
was originally disallowed on the acquisition of the goods or services. 
 
128 Section 18(16)(a), read with section 16(3)(h). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 9 
 
 85 
Example 28 – Goods partially applied for taxable supplies subsequently sold 
Fact: 
A vendor purchases a computer system during May 2016 costing R57 000 (including R7 000 
VAT) which is used 60% for exempt supplies and 40% for taxable supplies. The apportionment 
percentage was determined using the turnover-based method at the time of acquisition. The 
vendor correctly deducted input tax of R2 800 (that is, 14 / 114 × R57 000 × 40%).  
Two years later (15 May 2018), the vendor sells the computer system for R46 000 (including 
R6 000 VAT). The vendor is therefore required to account for output tax of R 6 000 on this 
transaction. Since the time of supply for the adjustment was after 1 April 2018, the tax fraction 
15/115 applies to calculate the VAT on the adjustment. 
Result: 
However, an input tax credit may be deducted in the same VAT return on the VAT previously 
disallowed (60% for exempt supplies), which is determined by the formula:  
A × B × C 
Where: 
A represents the tax fraction, that is, 15/115 
B represents the lesser of: 
 (i)  the adjusted cost of the computer system, namely, R54 000; or  
 (ii) the OMV of the computer system, namely, R46 000 
C represents the extent of the exempt use of the computer system before its sale by the 
vendor (that is, 60%) 
The vendor’s calculation of the deduction from the vendor’s output tax will be:  
 15 / 115 × R46 000 × 60% = R3 600 
The vendor will therefore account for VAT in field 4A of the VAT return as follows: 
Output tax on sale  R6 000 
Less: Input tax (R3 600) 
Output tax payable R2 400

Chapter 10  
Calculation of VAT and submission of returns 
10.1 The VAT201 return 
The VAT201 return is a declaration which must be completed and submitted to SARS at the 
end of every tax period if you are a vendor. The return reflects the VAT that you have charged 
on supplies (or situations in which you are otherwise liable to declare output tax), and the 
amounts that you believe you are entitled to deduct as input tax. 129 The difference between 
these amounts for a specific tax period could either result in you having to pay the difference 
to SARS, or you may be entitled to a refund of the difference. Vendors must submit their 
returns by the due date, even if there is no payment required for the tax period concerned. 
Vendors are encouraged to register for eFiling, as this is a free and convenient internet-based 
service which allows you to make submissions and electronic payments to SARS from your home 
or office. Registration for eFiling and the submission of VAT201 dec larations via eFiling is 
compulsory for VAT registered non-resident suppliers of electronic services. Vendors who use 
eFiling have until the last working day of the month to make submissions and payments  via 
electronic means. Vendors who are registered on eFiling must request their VAT201 returns 
electronically on eFiling so that they can be made available on their eFiling profiles. A unique 
19 digit Payment Reference Number (PRN) is pre-populated on the VAT201 by SARS and you 
must use this PRN when making your VAT payment to SARS. Each VAT201 return requested 
on eFiling from SARS will have its own unique PRN which will be used to track individual 
payments and queries for that tax period only. 
Vendors who submit their returns manually are required to request the VAT201 return from the 
nearest SARS office in person, in writing, or telephonically via the SARS Service Centre on 
0800 00 7277. Vendors are advised to request their VAT201 returns at the beginning of the 
month in which the return is due for submission to ensure that these are received in enough time 
to meet the submission deadline. Note that SARS will not accept – 
• old format VAT201 returns; 
• copies of VAT201 declarations printed from eFiling and used for manual submission;  
• manually submitted VAT201 returns by vendors falling within Category C tax period; 
and 
• photocopied returns. 
SARS may implement further changes regarding the VAT201 return or payments at any time 
as part of ongoing modernisation initiatives. Vendors are therefore advised to check the 
SARS website for the latest information. From December 2020, the VAT201 return on eFiling 
has been converted from Adobe Flex to HTML5 format for better user experience and 
compatibility. For more information, please refer to the updated  Guide for completing the 
Value-Added Tax VAT201 Declaration. Additional information can also be sourced from the 
How To Download The New SARS eFiling Browser Guide. 
 
129 For purposes of this Chapter, the term “input tax” is used to refer to input tax and all other deductions 
to which a vendor is entitled in calculati ng the VAT liability or refund for a tax period. (See 8.1 for 
more information.) 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 10 
 
 87 
10.2  How to calculate your VAT 
The basic steps in calculating your VAT liability or refund and completing your return are as 
follows: 
STEP 1: Determine the VAT charged (output tax)  – The amount of VAT that you account 
for is based on whether you are registered to account for VAT on the invoice or payments 
basis: 
• Invoice basis – Add the consideration in respect of all the sales invoices (cash and 
credit sales, including the VAT) issued by you in the tax period concerned in respect 
of taxable supplies, regardless of whether payment has been received or not. Also 
include the conside ration for supplies not yet invoiced where payment has already 
been made for the supply.  
• Payments basis – Add all the actual payments (including the VAT) received by you in 
the tax period concerned, whether in respect of taxable supplies made during that tax 
period, in a past tax period or to be made in a future tax period. 
See Chapter 4 for more details on the invoice and payments basis of accounting for VAT. 
Fields 1 to 12 are the fields which must be completed in respect of any output tax which you 
are required to account for in the relevant tax period. 
Field 13 reflects the total amount of output tax and is the sum of the fields 4, 4A, 9, 11 and 12. 
STEP 2: Calculate your input tax – As is the case with regard to output tax in Step 1 above, 
the amount of input tax that you can deduct is based on , amongst other things, whether you 
are registered to account for VAT on the invoice or payments basis.130 
• Invoice basis – Add the VAT incurred on goods or services acquired by you for taxable 
purposes, for all the tax invoices (cash and credit purchases) received by you in the 
tax period concerned, regardless of whether you have made payment to the supplier 
or not. 
• Payments basis – Add VAT incurred on goods or services acquired by you for taxable 
purposes, to the extent of the actual payment of the consideration that you have made 
in the tax period concerned to suppliers in respect of current or past taxable supplies 
received. 
Remember the following: 
• Whether you are registered on the invoice or payments basis of accounting, you cannot 
deduct input tax or any part thereof unless you are in possession of documents 
prescribed by or which is acceptable to the Commissioner. 
• Certain business inputs are subject to special rules and limitations, or may be 
specifically denied. Make separate lists for the VAT paid in respect of capital and other 
goods imported, as these amounts must be reflected separately on the return.  
See Chapter 4 for more details on the invoice and payments basis of accounting for VAT.  
See Chapter 8 for more details on what amounts qualify as deductible input tax. 
 
130  Any claim for input tax or other deductions is limited to a period of five years (see the proviso to 
section 16(3).  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 10 
 
 88 
Fields 14 – 18 are the fields which must be completed in respect of any input tax which you 
believe you are entitled to deduct against the output tax liability in field 13. 
Field 19 reflects the total amount of input tax which you are entitled to deduct for the tax period 
concerned. 
STEP 3: Pay the difference or claim your refund – Field 20 is the difference between your 
totals in fields 13 and 19. If the amount in field 13 is larger than the amount in field 19, the 
difference is VAT payable to SARS. If the amount in field 19 is larger than the amount in field 
13, the difference is the VAT refundable to you. 
Fields 21 – 33 are the fields where certain vendors will claim any eligible diesel purchases 
under the Customs and Excise Act (diesel refund) as a deduction against any liability for VAT. 
Most vendors will not complete this field as it only applies if you qualify and have registered 
for the diesel refund scheme. 
Field 34 reflects the total amount of VAT payable/refundable and is calculated by adding fields 
25, 29 and 33 together and subtracting the total from the value in field 20. If field 34 is less 
than zero, a refund is due to you and if it is larger than zero , you need to pay that amount as 
VAT which is due to SARS. 
See the Step-by-Step Guide for the Completion of the Value -Added Tax Vendor Declaration 
Form and the Guide for Value-Added Tax via eFiling for more details on how to complete the 
individual fields on the return and to calculate your VAT. 
10.3 Submitting a return 
Once you have completed the return, check it carefully as you can be held liable for penalties 
and interest if there are errors which lead to any shortfall in VAT paid. For ease of processing, 
vendors making manual submissions should ensure that the VAT201 return is duly completed 
and signed. 
Section 28 prescribes the due dates for submitting VAT returns and making VAT payments. 
Your return must be submitted together with payment of the VAT on or before the 25 th day of 
the following month after the end of your tax period. Should the 25th day fall on a Saturday, 
Sunday or public holiday, then your submission must be made on the last working day before 
such 25th day. Alternatively, you have until the last business day of the month after the end of 
your tax period if you make use of eFiling  to submit your return and make payment by 
electronic means (that is, payment submitted on eFiling or effected by electronic funds transfer 
(EFT) through internet banking ).131 For example, if your tax period ends on 31  March, you 
have until 25 April to submit the return and payment (or until 30 April if using eFiling to submit 
your return and make payment electronically). The date by which the return must be submitted 
to SARS is shown on the front of the return. SARS has removed drop boxes for the submission 
of returns, in its drive to encourage taxpayers to use eFiling.  See 10.4 for more details on the 
various payment options. 
 
131 Section 28. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 10 
 
 89 
10.3.1 What if a mistake is made in the return? 
Section 25(5) of the TA Act allows SARS to request a person to submit an amended return for 
the correction of an undisputed error made in a return, before SARS issuing an original 
assessment. As the filing of a VAT return is considered to be an original assessment ,132 an 
error on a VAT return can therefore only be remedied by the vendor making a request for 
correction. 
SARS may issue an additional assessment if satisfied that the VAT return does not reflect the 
correct application of the law to the disadvantage of SARS. 1
133 SARS may withdraw an 
assessment if it was –134 
• issued to the incorrect taxpayer; or 
• issued in respect of the incorrect tax period; or 
• issued as a result of an incorrect payment allocation. 
For more information on how to apply for a request for a correction, see the Request for 
Correction webpage. Furthermore, see Chapter 14  and the  Short Guide to the Tax 
Administration Act, 2011 for more information on the various assessments. 
10.4 How to pay your VAT 
The TA Act provides that tax is payable either on a date specified in a tax Act, or on a date 
specified by the Commissioner in a public notice. The VAT Act specifies the date by when 
VAT must be paid, but in the event of SARS issuing an assessment, the vendor will b e 
provided with a period to pay the amount due as per the assessment. The TA Act makes 
provision for an expedited due date for payment, or the ability to require for security to be 
submitted, where there is a risk of dissipation of assets to evade or frust rate the collection of 
tax. See the Short Guide on the Tax Administration Act, 2011, for more information. 
Payments have to be done  electronically or over the counter at the branch of an approved 
bank. SARS branches or offices no longer accept manual forms of payment of the VAT . As 
South African banks no longer accept cheque payments with effect from 1 January 2021, 
SARS also ceased to accept cheque payments from that date. Cheques received by SARS 
will be returned to the vendor. Category C vendors must file VAT returns on eFiling and make 
VAT payments electronically on eFiling or by EFT . Please note that SARS branches will 
continue to assist vendors with the completion and submission or acceptance of VAT returns.  
Do not under any circumstances send cash in the post. SARS does not accept payments via 
the post office, including by way of a postal order or money order. The options available to 
vendors to make payments are discussed in 10.4.1 to 10.4.3. 
For more details see the GEN-PAYM-01-G01 – SARS Payment Rules – External Guide.

134 Section 98(1) of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 10 
 
 90 
10.4.1 Payment by EFT 
An electronic transfer of funds must reach SARS by or before the due date shown on the 
VAT201 return (usually the 25th of the month, unless if filed via eFiling which will allow you to 
submit the return and make payment by the last business day of the month). Please enquire 
from your bank whether "same day" transfers are made to SARS. If not, you must make the 
transfer earlier to ensure that it is in SARS’s bank account by the 25 th of the month after the 
end of the tax period, the last preceding business da y before the 25 th of that month as 
mentioned in 10.3 or the last business day of the month for eFilers. Penalties and interest will 
be imposed should electronic transfers be received in SARS’s banking account after the due 
date. Should you have any further enquiries relating to these limits, please contact your bank. 
Non-resident suppliers of electronic services may only use the EFT method to pay their VAT. 
Payment must be made using the SWIFT MT103 payment method.  See VAT-REG-01-
G02 – VAT Registration Guide for Foreign Suppliers of Electronic Services for more 
information. 
10.4.2 Payment by using eFiling 
All SARS business customers are able to subscribe to SARS’s eFiling service to submit 
specific returns and payments electronically via the internet at no charge. By subscribing to 
eFiling, vendors are able to receive, complete and submit VAT returns and ma ke payments 
via secure internet-based facilities 24-hours a day. 
The type of payment service available on eFiling is the credit push. The credit push refers to 
payment transactions that are initiated on eFiling and presented to the vendor’s bank as a 
payment request, pending authorisation. Once a vendor has logged into the banking services 
and effected the payment, it becomes irrevocable. 
For more information about the SARS eFiling service and how to register, see the Guide for 
Value-Added Tax via eFiling, or log on to www.sarsefiling.co.za. If you have any queries you 
can contact the SARS Service Centre on 0800 00 7277 between 08h00 – 17h00 on weekdays.  
10.4.3 Payments at various banks 
You may choose to pay your VAT at certain banks. Please make sure that your payment is 
made on or before the due date reflected on the VAT return.135 Please note that you must still 
send your VAT201 return to SARS for capturing even if you have made payment at the bank 
or if you are submitting a nil return. 
You must ensure that payment will reach SARS by the due date shown on the VAT return. 
SARS has emphasised that payments received late as a result of these changes would lead 
to penalties and interest being imposed. Therefore, to avoid these amounts from being levied, 
kindly adhere to the time frames for the submission of VAT returns and payments tabled 
below:

Note that in the case where no taxable supplies were made, or there is otherwise no tax 
payable for the relevant tax period, you must submit a nil return to SARS. 
10.5 Payment limits (EFT / eFiling / bank payments) 
The banks and the Payments Association of South Africa (PASA) have set payment limits on 
ATM transactions and electronic payments. These measures are aimed at moving high-value 
payments to the South African Multiple Option Settlement system (SAMOS), operated through 
the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The limit  for credit payments made via EFT  is 
R5 000 000. 
The following is how these limits will affect you as a vendor: 
• EFT payments in excess of R5 000 000 must be cleared with your banker. 
• With the exception of a few banks,137 eFiling transactions will not be affected by these 
rules as no limits are imposed. 
10.6 Managing your payment 
The eFiling system provides for a VAT payment allocation function and a VAT Statement of 
Account (VATSA). The VAT payment allocation function enables vendors to allocate 
payments, to reallocate payments and to locate missing payments. These functions can b e 
performed by vendors without requiring any intervention from SARS. Manual filers and those 
eFilers that require assistance can approach SARS for assistance in making these allocation 
adjustments via the SARS Online Query System on the SARS website. 
The VATSA is similar to the Employer Statement of Account (EMPSA) and is issued by SARS 
upon request. The VATSA contains information which will empower vendors to manage their 
VAT accounts by giving them insight into their transactions per tax period. 
Vendors can request the VATSA through the following channels: 
• Electronically via eFiling 
• By calling the SARS Service Centre on 0800 00 SARS (7277) 
 
136  Although reference is made here to “manual” submissions, SARS no longer issues VAT201 returns 
and does not handle post or process physical VAT201 returns any longer. Manual submission refers 
to a situation where a vendor is not registered on eFiling and will have to call at a SARS branch 
office or service centre for assistance to complete the return online. 
137 There are some banks that can only process payments with a maximum limit of R5  000 000. For 
payments above that amount, arrangements will have to be specifically made with such banks. For 
more details see the GEN-PAYM-01-G01 – SARS Payment Rules – External Guide.

For more information, please see the SARS website. 
10.7 Refunds 
The provisions relating to refunds are dealt with in sections 16(5) and 44 of the VAT Act, read 
with Chapter 13 of the TA Act. A vendor is entitled to a refund of a properly refundable amount 
(including any interest which may be due thereon), 138 under the VAT  Act, as reflected in a 
correctly completed refund return or of an amount that was erroneously paid in excess of an 
amount due. The refund should be made by SARS within 21 business days of receiving your 
correctly completed VAT return. If the refund is not paid within the said period, interest will be 
paid to you at the prescribed rate. There are, however, a few exceptional circumstances where 
SARS may withhold a refund or suspend the 21 business day period without the payment of 
interest. 
SARS may withhold a refund until – 
• SARS is satisfied that a defect in, or incompleteness of a VAT return submitted by the 
vendor does not affect the amount to be refunded or such defect or incompleteness is 
rectified by the vendor; 
• details of the vendor’s bank account have been provided; 
• a vendor has filed all outstanding VAT returns;  
• SARS is satisfied that a refund claimed will be refunded by the vendor to another party 
where that vendor’s output tax is borne by that other party;1
139 or 
• a verification, inspection or audit of the refund has been finalised, unless acceptable 
security has been provided. 
If a vendor provides acceptable security, SARS may release a refund before verification, 
inspection or audit is finalised. 
SARS will pay you the refund if it is claimed in a VAT return that is submitted within a period 
of five years from the date that the submission of such VAT return became due, provided you 
do not owe any amounts relating to other taxes administered by the Commissioner. Should 
you owe amounts on other taxes, debt equalisation will be applied to offset the amounts owing 
in respect of other taxes, and the balance (if any) will be refunded. Please note that the set-
off may be made between the main registration of a vendor and any of its branches , or 
between any of the branches and the main registration, or between any branches of the same 
legal entity.  
In order to reduce the risk of VAT fraud, SARS makes use of a sophisticated risk engine that 
applies objective risk criteria, including third party data to identify high risk VAT refund claims 
for further investigation and audit each month. The payment of an undue refund by SARS to 
a vendor is regarded as an outstanding tax debt due by the vendor from the date on which the 
refund amount wa s paid. Interest accrues and is payable by the vendor on the amount not 
properly payable to the vendor, from the date of payment of such amount by SARS.140  
 
138 Section 190(1) of the TA Act. 
139 Section 44(3)(c) read with Chapter 13 of the TA Act. 
140 Section 190(5) of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 10 
 
 93 
You can make use of the Refund Dashboard which is a function that will enable you to view 
the reasons why your refunds may not have been paid out and what actions may be required 
of you. Only the status of refunds from March  2011 will be displayed on the Refund 
Dashboard. This function is available on eFiling for registered eFilers. Vendors who call the 
Service Centre or go to a SARS Service Centre to request information will be assisted by 
SARS agents who have access to the dashboard. 
A decision not to authorise a refund is subject to objection and appeal. See the Short Guide 
on the Tax Administration Act, 2011 for more information on refunds. 
10.8 Change of bank details 
Only non -resident companies and resident companies that are part of the same group 
structure may request that VAT refunds be paid into a bank account of a nominated person. 
In the case of a “subsidiary company” or “holding company” as contemplated in the Companies 
Act, VAT refunds may be paid into the bank account of either the subsidiary company or 
holding company, on condition that SARS is indemnified against any loss which may occur. 
Due to concerns involving VAT refund fraud, the use of third party bank  accounts will not be 
permitted in any other cases. 
Should you wish to nominate or use the bank account of another vendor, you must supply the 
necessary authority from the account holder (for example, company resolution) and provide 
indemnity to SARS against possible losses of amounts paid into such account s on form 
VAT119i. This form is available from SARS offices or the SARS website. 
The fraudulent changes to vendors’ bank details remain one of the biggest risks that SARS 
has to deal with. SARS has a responsibility to protect vendors from any fraudulent transactions 
on their accounts emanating from within SARS or by the actions of others that are interacting 
with the VAT system who purport to act on behalf of vendors. To prevent such risks, vendors 
should note that under no circumstances will SARS request a vendor’s bank account details 
over the phone or accept bank account detail changes via telephone or e-mail. 
In order for a request to change bank details to be considered, the vendor or the authorised 
representative vendor’s details must always match the existing details on the SARS system 
and only changes through the following channels will be accepted: 
• In person at any SARS branch. (This is the preferred channel.) 
• Through the SARS eFiling channel if you are registered as an eFiler. 
• Via email only in exceptional circumstances. 
Vendors wanting to change bank account details, must please ensure that they have the 
documents required as set out in the GEN-GEN-41-G01 – Change of Banking Details  – 
External Guide. Supporting documents for change of bank details can be submitted via eFiling 
or on the SARS website. For more information, see the Change My Banking Details page on 
the SARS website.

Chapter 11  
Penalties and interest 
11.1 Introduction 
The rules regarding penalties and interest are mainly dealt with in the TA Act since its 
introduction in 2012, although the interest provisions have, to a large extent, not come into 
effect yet. The penalty for late payment contained in section 39 of the VAT Act is a percentage-
based non -compliance penalty and is imposed in line with the procedure contained in 
section 213 of the TA Act. The percentage -based penalty is distinct from a fixed -amount 
penalty which is imposed when a vendor does not comply with an obligation that is contained 
in a public notice141 issued by the Commissioner.F In addition, specific acts of non-compliance 
that give rise to prejudice can result in an understatement penalty imposed under the TA Act. 
(See 11.2.2.) 
The administrative non-compliance penalty and the understatement penalty regime, together 
with criminal sanctions, provide a comprehensive framework to deter non -compliance. The 
purpose of the penalty regime is to ensure the widest possible compliance of the tax Acts in a 
way that is impartial and consistent and is proportional to the seriousness and duration of the 
incidence of non-compliance. 
The interest rules to be imposed by the TA Act will only come into effect once a public notice 
is issued by the Commissioner. Until such time, the current rules will still apply. 
See Interpretation Note 68 “Provisions of the Tax Administration Act, 2011, that did not 
Commence on 1 October 2012 under Proclamation No. 51 in Government Gazette 35687” for 
more information on the provisions that did not come into effect on 1 October 2012. 
This chapter provides a brief overview of the penalty provisions under Chapters 15 and 16 of 
the TA Act and the interest provisions envisaged under Chapter 12 of the TA Act. 
11.2 Penalties 
11.2.1 Administrative non-compliance penalties 
An administrative non-compliance penalty means a penalty imposed by SARS in accordance 
with Chapter 15 of the TA Act, and excludes an understatement penalty. It comprises both 
fixed-amount and percentage -based penalties. A fixed -amount penalty is charged when an 
administrative obligation is not complied with, and the percentage-based penalty is generally 
imposed when certain amounts of tax are not paid. 
Fixed-amount penalties 
A fixed amount penalty is imposed when a vendor does not comply with a legally required 
obligation. Such penalties may only be imposed in respect of the non -compliance listed in a 
public notice142 issued by the Commissioner and not every act of non-compliance under a tax 
Act. 
 
141 Section 210(2) of the TA Act. 
142 See the Public Notice 790 in GG 35733 of 1 October 2012. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 11 
 
 95 
Percentage-based penalties 
A percentage-based penalty is imposed if SARS is satisfied that an amount of tax was not 
paid as and when required under the tax Act. In the case of VAT, SARS may impose a penalty 
equal to the percentage, as prescribed in the VAT  Act, of the amount of unpa id tax.  The 
procedure for the imposition and remittance of a percentage-based penalty is regulated by the 
TA Act.143 
The circumstances that trigger the imposition of the penalty remains in the VAT  Act for 
example, when a vendor fails to pay VAT within the period allowed for payment, a 10% penalty 
is imposed. Section  213 of the TA Act imposes the penalty and section  39 of the VAT Act 
prescribes the applicable percentage, which is currently 10%. 
11.2.2 Understatement penalty 
Any understatement penalty (USP) which is applicable will be included in an assessment 
issued by SARS and must be paid by the date specified in the notice of assessment. USP 
may only be imposed if the fiscus is prejudiced by the vendor’s conduct in reporting  its VAT 
liability. The fiscus will be prejudiced if there is a shortfall, which is the difference between the 
correct amount of tax that should have been paid and the amount that was paid by the vendor 
in respect of a tax period. 
The prejudice must have been because a vendor –  
• defaulted in rendering a return; 
• filed a return but omitted an item from that return; 
• filed a return in which an incorrect statement was made; 
• failed to pay the correct amount of tax in instances where a return is not required;  
• entered into an impermissible avoidance arrangement. (For VAT purposes, this would 
be any scheme or arrangement to which section 73 applies.)  
For instance, if a vendor did not file a return but conducted an enterprise and should have filed 
VAT returns and paid VAT of R90  000, the shortfall is the difference between R90  000 and 
zero. The shortfall is, therefore, an expression of the prejudice to the fiscus. The USP table is 
then used to identify the highest applicable percentage to each shortfall in relation to each 
understatement in a return that best describes the facts of the case and the vendor’s behaviour 
in respect of each understatement of that return. 
 
143 Sections 217 and 218 of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 11 
 
 96 
USP table144 
The TA Act provides for different rates of USP, based on the type of behaviour or the degree 
of culpability involved, as shown in the table below:  
1 2 3 4 5 6 
Item Behaviour Standard case If obstructive, or 
if it is a ‘repeat 
case’ 
Voluntary 
disclosure after 
notification of 
audit or criminal 
investigation 
Voluntary 
disclosure 
before 
notification of 
audit or criminal 
investigation 
(i) ‘Substantial 
understatement’ 
10% 20% 5% 0% 
(ii) Reasonable 
care not taken 
in completing 
return 
25% 50% 15% 0% 
(iii) No reasonable 
grounds for ‘tax 
position’ taken 
50% 75% 25% 0% 
(iv) ‘Impermissible 
avoidance 
arrangement’ 
75% 100% 35% 0% 
(v) Gross 
negligence 
100% 125% 50% 5% 
(vi) Intentional tax 
evasion 
150% 200% 75% 10% 
As mentioned above, t he amount of USP is determined by applying the highest applicable 
understatement penalty percentage in accordance with the USP table to the shortfall in each 
tax period. In other words, if a vendor’s behaviour involves both no reasonable grounds for a 
tax position taken (item (iii) in the table) and gross negligence (item (v) in the table), then the 
latter behaviour will apply in working out the amount of USP to be levied for the tax period 
concerned. 
No USP will, however, be imposed if the vendor can prove that the understatement was as a 
result of a bona fide inadvertent error. 
The various behaviours will indicate the extent of the penalty that might be imposed. Once the 
behaviour has been determined, SARS must determine whether – 
• the vendor made a voluntary disclosure before or after being notified of an audit; 
• the vendor was obstructive when engaging with SARS officials; 
• it is a repeat case; or 
• the case is not defined by any of the above and is thus a standard case. 
 
144  See section 223 of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 11 
 
 97 
If none of these behaviours can be identified, USP could still be imposed if the prejudice to 
SARS is the greater of 5% of the tax properly chargeable or R1  million. This is referred to as 
a “substantial understatement”. 
See the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act , 2011 for more details on the various 
behaviours. 
11.3 Interest 
Chapter 12 of the TA Act provides that interest due or payable will be calculated on the daily 
balance owing and will be compounded monthly. This gives effect to the principle that interest 
is compensation for the loss of the use of money. The compounded method of calculating 
interest will only apply as and when the Commissioner publishes a notice announcing when 
the new interest calculation method will apply, as well as the tax to which this method of 
interest will apply. 
See the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act , 2011 and Interpretation Note 68 
“Provisions of the Tax Administration Act, 2011, that did not Commence on 1 October 2012 
under Proclamation No.  51 in Government Gazette 35687” for more details on the interest 
rules envisaged under the TA Act. 
The current rules provide that interest at the pre scribed rate145 will be charged per month or 
part thereof on late payments of VAT. The prescribed rate is linked to the rate determined 
under section 80 of the PFMA. Interest is calculated from the first day of the month after the 
month in which payment was due, until the outstanding amount is paid. Interest is also charged 
on any late payment of the USP which has been levied upon assessment. 
Example 29 – Calculation of interest 
Facts: 
P is required to submit a VAT return and payment of R3  000 in respect of the  
March 2019 tax period by 25  April 2019. P only submits th e return and payment on 
25 May 2019.  
Result: 
The interest (per month) is calculated as follows: 
  R3 000 × 10,25%146 interest per month or part of a month × 1 / 12 (Interest payable for 
1 month)  
 = R25,63  
 
145 See the Interest Rates – Table 1 for the applicable rate. 
146 The rate changes from time-to-time under section 80 of the PFMA. In this example, the rate at the 
time was 10,25% per annum.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 11

11.4 Remission of penalties and interest 
11.4.1 Remission of non-compliance penalty 
A vendor may apply to SARS to remit both the fixed -amount and percentage-based penalty 
before the date the penalty must be paid. With effect from 14 October 2016, a request for 
remission of the non-compliance penalty can only be made via two channels, namely, eFiling 
or by visiting a SARS branch. The request for remission must be submitted on the prescribed 
form (RFR01 – Request for Remission). If a vendor has not filed the remittance request before 
the date that the penalty must be paid, SARS may condone a late request for remission under 
specific circumstances.147 Payment of the penalty is automatically suspended from the day 
the request to remit is received by SARS until 21 business days after SARS notifies the vendor 
of the decision whether to remit the penalty or not.  
For more details see  GEN-PEN-05-G02 – How to Submit a Dispute via eFiling – External 
Guide and the “What if I Do Not Agree” page under “Client segments” on the SARS website.  
SARS may remit a percentage-based administrative penalty if satisfied that all of the following 
conditions are met: 
• The amount involved is either less than R2 000, or the non-payment is a first incidence  
• The vendor has reasonable grounds explaining the non-compliance 
• The incidence of non-payment has been remedied148 
A “first incidence” means that no other penalty (fixed or percentage -based) must have been 
imposed within a period of 36 months preceding the one in respect of which the remission is 
concerned.149 
A vendor may also qualify for the remission of a percentage -based penalty if exceptional 
circumstances exist for non -compliance. The exceptional circumstances as prescribed in 
section 218 of the TA Act must have made it impossible for the vendor to have complied with 
the obligation to pay on time. The circumstances regarded to be exceptional are as follows: 
• A natural or human-made disaster 
• A civil disturbance or disruption in services 
• The vendor suffers a serious illness or was involved in a serious accident 
• The vendor suffers a serious emotional or mental distress 
• Certain acts by SARS, such as capturing errors, processing delays 
• The vendor suffers serious financial hardship 
• Any other circumstances of analogous seriousness 
Should SARS decide not to remit or reduce the administrative non -compliance penalty, the 
vendor may object to this decision under the Dispute Resolution provisions of the TA Act 
(see Chapter 14). This is a qualification of the right to object and appeal process in that the 
objection and appeal lies against the decision not to remit the penalty and not against the 
penalty assessment. 
 
147 Section 215 of the TA Act. 
148 Section 217(3) of the TA Act. 
149 See the definition of “first incidence” in section 208 of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 11 
 
 99 
SARS may remit administrative non-compliance penalties in respect of tax defaults voluntarily 
disclosed for which relief has been sought and granted under the voluntary disclosure 
programme (VDP). For the relief to be granted, the vendor must voluntarily disclose the default 
by submitting a valid VDP application in the prescribed form. Only if the outcome of the VDP 
application is positive will relief be granted to a vendor. The relief is based on a VDP 
agreement which successful applicants will be required to enter into with SARS. 
For more details on the voluntary disclosure programme see the following documents which 
can be accessed on the SARS website: 
• GEN-VDP-02-G01 – External Guide – Voluntary Disclosure Programme 
• Voluntary Disclosure Programme page 
11.4.2 Remission of understatement penalty 
SARS may grant relief in respect of a portion of the USP incurred in respect of tax defaults 
voluntarily disclosed for which relief has been sought and granted under the VDP. The relief 
is in the form of a reduced or zero percentage penalty as compared to the higher percentage 
applicable for similar behaviours had the vendor not voluntarily disclosed the tax defaults. See 
11.2.2 for the reduced percentages. 
In all other cases, a vendor may object to the USP being imposed and request a re -
classification of the behaviour or for circumstances not previously considered to be taken into 
account by SARS. If the objection is allowed, this may result in a reduction o f the USP 
imposed, or a decision that no USP should be imposed in a case where the understatement 
results from a bona fide inadvertent error. See the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 
2011 for more information. 
11.4.3 Remission of interest 
The TA Act makes provision for interest to be remitted or reduced in certain exceptional 
circumstances.150 The factors which are taken into account in determining if a remission of 
interest may be made are different from those which must be considered regarding the 
remission of a non-compliance penalty or USP as discussed in 11.4.1 and 11.4.2. 
The Commissioner’s discretion to remit interest is limited to whether or not the payment of tax 
was made within time as a result of circumstances beyond the vendor’s control. An example 
of this is when a vendor’s payment instruction could not be carried out by the vendor’s bank 
in time because of a failure in the ba nking system. See Interpretation Note 61 “Remission of 
Interest” for more information.151 
With effect from 14 October 2016, a request for remission of interest may only be made via 
eFiling or at a SARS branch once you have paid any tax which is due in that regard. Note that 
the remission of interest will only be considered where substantive reasons are given for a 
late payment. This means that properly motivated mitigating circumstances must be submitted 
for consideration together with any evidence which supports your case for the remission of 
interest. 
 
150 Section 187(6) of the TA Act.  
151  See also section 39(7)(a) of the VAT Act which has not yet been repealed. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 11 
 
 100 
As all the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors must be considered by the Commissioner 
when making a decision in this regard, a failure to submit adequate reasons will mean that 
there will be no basis upon which the Commissioner will be able to exercise any discretion in 
the matter. The mitigating circumstances and evidence which you submit to support your case 
should therefore demonstrate to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that the circumstances which 
lead to the late payment or non-payment of VAT were beyond your control. 
Only the following circumstances may be considered to be beyond the vendor’s control: 
• A natural or human made disaster 
• A civil disturbance or disruption in services 
• A serious illness or accident 
The right to request the remission of interest cannot be open -ended, as finality has to be 
achieved within a reasonable period of time, which is at least before the matter becomes 
prescribed in law. Therefore, SARS may not remit interest payable by a vendor after a period 
of five years from the date that the interest first accrued.152 
A request for remission is the only remedy available to a vendor to dispute interest on late 
payment of VAT . A vendor is not allowed to lodge an objection to dispute interest on late 
payment or a decision by SARS to disallow a request for remission. (See Chapter 14 for more 
information on objections.) 
For more information on interest, see the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 2011.

Chapter 12  
Exports and imports 
12.1 Exports 
A vendor may levy VAT at the zero rate on the supply of movable goods which are exported 
by either the vendor (direct export) or a qualifying purchaser in limited circumstances (indirect 
export) to any export country. A “qualifying purchaser” includes a non -resident, a tourist, a 
foreign enterprise, a foreign diplomat, a person who acquires and sells goods on a flash title 
basis, certain international organisations or organisations which are similar to an association 
not for gain or a welfare organisation which are registered as such in an export country. 
A direct export is where the supplying vendor (the supplier) consigns or delivers movable 
goods to a recipient at an address in an export country. The supplier is in control of the export 
and the zero rate of VAT will apply if the requirements stipulated in Interpretation Note 30 “The 
Supply of Movable Goods as Contemplated in Section 11(1)(a)(i) read with Paragraph (a) of 
the Definition of “Exported” and the Corresponding Documentary Proof” have been met. Also 
see 12.1.1  for more details. 
An indirect export refers to a situation where goods are exported by the recipient (being a 
“qualifying purchaser” as defined in the Export Regulations) 153 and that person removes or 
arranges for the removal and transport of movable goods to an address in an export country. 
Indirect exports are currently regulated by the Export Regulations. If an indirect export is 
subject to VAT at the standard rate, the qualifying purchaser may claim a refund from the VAT 
Refund Administrator (Pty) Ltd (the VRA)154 as set out in the Export Regulations. Alternatively, 
the vendor may elect to zero -rate the supply of the movable goods, subject to certain 
requirements set out in the Export Regulations. See 12.1.2 for more details. 
For both direct and indirect exports, the movable goods must be exported through one of the 
43 designated commercial ports listed in the table on the following page.

12.1.1 Direct exports 
In order to apply the zero rate, the supplier must either – 
• physically deliver the goods to the recipient, the recipient’s duly appointed agent or the 
recipient’s customer at an address in an export country (“deliver”); or 
• obtain the services of a cartage contractor who is contractually obliged to deliver the 
goods on behalf of the supplier to the recipient, the recipient’s duly appointed agent or 
the recipient’s customer at an address in an export country (“consign”). 
 
155  Swaziland is now known as eSwatini but at the time of publishing this guide, it had not yet been 
amended in the VAT Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 103 
The cartage contractor is a person whose activities include the transportation of goods and 
includes couriers and freight forwarders. The transportation of goods does not have to be the 
main activity of the cartage contractor and the cartage contractor is also not required to be a 
registered vendor. The cartage contractor must invoice the supplier, being the person who is 
liable for payment of the full costs of the delivery services rendered. 
The zero rate will apply on condition that the following documentary proof has been obtained 
and retained: 
• The supplier’s copy of the zero-rated tax invoice. 
• The recipient’s order or contract between the supplier and the recipient. 
• The transport documentation as required for the relevant mode of transport. 
• Export documentation as prescribed under the Customs and Excise Act (for example, 
the SARS Customs Declaration). 
• Proof of payment in respect of the supply of the movable goods. 
• Where applicable: Proof of payment of the transport costs by the supplier where a 
cartage contractor was used to deliver the movable goods. 
• Where the goods are transported by road or rail, proof that the goods were received 
by the recipient in the export country. 
The time period within which the movable goods must be exported from the RSA and the time 
period within which the required documentary proof must be obtained are stipulated in 
Interpretation Note 30 which time periods  have been aligned with the Export Regulations . 
See Part Three of the Export Regulations discussed below. 
12.1.2 Indirect exports 
The Export Regulations set out the specific procedures applicable to goods exported indirectly. 
In the case of indirect exports, the supplier will charge VAT at the standard rate, unless the 
supplier has elected to apply the zero rate under Part Two of the  Export Regulations. If the 
supplier has charged VAT at the standard rate, the qualifying purchaser may apply to the VRA 
for a VAT refund. 
The Export Regulations generally apply to supplies made on or after 2  May 2014. A special 
transitional rule is also included to provide for the challenges relating to progressive supplies. 
The Export Regulations will apply in the case of progressive suppli es spanning 2 May 2014 
when all of the following conditions are met: 
• The goods are subject to processes contemplated in section 9(3)(b).  
• The invoice is issued and/or the payment is received before and after 2 May 2014. 
• Delivery of the goods takes place after 2 May 2014. 
The application of the above rules means that if all invoices and payments in relation to the 
goods have occurred before 2 May 2014, the rules under the previous VAT Export Incentive 
Scheme will apply, even if the goods are delivered (exported) after 2  May 2014. The rules 
under the VAT Export Incentive Scheme will also apply if the goods are delivered before 2 May 
2014 and any invoices are issued, or any payments are made in respect thereof, after 2 May 
2014. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 104 
The Export Regulation is divided into three main parts: 
• Part One deals with the procedures which must be followed by a qualifying purchaser 
when the supplier has charged VAT at the standard rate on the supply of movable 
goods which will be exported from the RSA by the qualifying purchaser or the qualifying 
purchaser’s cartage contractor. The qualifying purchaser is subsequently entitled to a 
refund of the VAT from the VRA subject to certain limitations or conditions contained 
in Part One. 
• Part Two deals with the procedures for the supplier who elects to supply movable 
goods at the zero rate and is split into two sections as follows: 
➢ Section A deals with the procedures for goods that are initially delivered to one 
of the designated harbours or airports or are supplied by means of a pipeline 
or an electrical transmission line in the RSA before being exported; and 
➢ Section B deals with the procedures for goods that are exported by road or rail 
through a designated commercial port. 
• Part Three deals with the various time periods within which movable goods must be 
exported from the RSA , the party responsible for exporting the goods as well as the 
time periods within which the required documentary proof must be obtained  by the 
supplier to substantiate the application of the zero-rate.  
Part One 
This Part provides that a qualifying purchaser, its duly appointed agent, or cartage contractor 
may export the movable goods. In this instance the vendor is obliged to levy VAT at the 
standard rate on the supply made to the qualifying purchaser and issue a  tax invoice. The 
qualifying purchaser may then claim a refund of the VAT paid on the goods exported. When 
the movable goods are exported, the goods must first be declared to a customs official at that 
exit point, before submitting the claim for a refund of the VAT paid to the VRA. The tax invoice 
for goods that are not kept as hand luggage must be endorsed by the customs official and a 
VRA official if the VRA has a physical presence at the relevant designated commercial port.156 
In the case where the VRA is present at the designated commercial port through which the 
qualifying purchaser departs, the qualifying purchaser or its authorised representative must 
present himself or herself to the VRA in order to get a refund of the VAT paid. If the goods are 
exported through a designated commercial port where the VRA is not present, the qualifying 
purchaser must apply in writing to the VRA for a refund. The application, together with all the 
required documentation, must be received by the VRA within 90 days from the date of export. 
This also applies in the case where the qualifying purchaser’s cartage contractor exports the 
goods. 
The VRA may make the VAT refund to the qualifying purchaser by way of various payment 
methods as described in r egulation 6 of the Export Regulations.157 The method of payment 
depends on several factors. The following important facts regarding the VAT refund must be 
noted: 
• For refunds of R300 or less, the VRA will issue the qualifying purchaser with payment 
in the currency of the RSA which can be used in the international departure lounge; 
alternatively, the refund may be effected by EFT. 
 
156 The VRA is only present at certain international airports in the Republic. 
157  Please note that due to cheques becoming obsolete with effect from 1 January 2021 the VRA will 
no longer be able to make payment by cheque. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 105 
• For refunds between R300 and R3  000, the VRA will issue the qualifying purchaser 
with a pre-paid debit card which can be used worldwide. 
• Under certain circumstances and provided certain conditions are met, the qualifying 
purchaser may be issued with payment in dollars or pounds or the refund may be 
debited directly to the credit card of the qualifying purchaser. 
• Qualifying purchasers from Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland (eSwatini) are not 
issued with this pre-paid debit card, but the refund will instead be transferred via EFT 
to the qualifying purchaser’s designated bank account. 
• All refunds due to a person as defined in the memorandum of understanding exporting 
goods from the Republic of South Africa and importing the goods into Lesotho and 
Swaziland (eSwatini) will be paid directly to the respective  revenue authorities under 
the memorandum of understanding between South Africa and each of the countries 
concerned. The Commissioner needs to approve any refund in excess of R3 000. 
• Goods consumed in the Republic cannot be refunded.

In summary, a qualifying purchaser will be entitled to a VAT refund where all of the following 
requirements are met: 
• The purchaser must be a qualifying purchaser as defined in the Export Regulations. 
• The goods must be exported within 90 days from the date of the tax invoice subject to 
certain exceptions.158  
• The VAT-inclusive total of all movable goods purchased during a particular visit to the 
RSA and exported at the end of that visit by the qualifying purchaser must exceed the 
minimum of R250 per qualifying purchaser.  
• The request for a refund, together with the relevant documentation, must be received 
by the VRA within 90 days of date of export. The Commissioner may extend the period 
within which an application for a refund must be submitted to the VRA in certain 
 
158 See regulation 15 of the Export Regulations. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 106 
circumstances that are beyond the control of the applicant . The se exceptional 
circumstances are set out in the Export Regulations.159 
• The goods must be exported through one of the 43 designated commercial ports by 
the qualifying purchaser or the qualifying purchaser’s cartage contractor or duly 
authorised agent. 
The qualifying purchaser must obtain the relevant documentary proof as described in Part 
One of the Export Regulations in order to prove that the movable goods were exported by 
road, sea, air or rail within the required 90 days.160 
Part Two – Section A 
This Part of the Export Regulations provides for a supplier to elect to supply movable goods 
to a qualifying purchaser at the zero rate where the goods are initially delivered to a harbour, 
an airport, or are supplied by means of a pipeline or electrical transmission line in the RSA 
before being exported. A supplier who elects to apply the zero  rate as provided for in 
Part Two – Section A of the Export Regulations must obtain the relevant documentary proof 
as contemplated in the said Part to substantiate the application of the zero rate. 
Highlighted below are a few examples of transactions where The Export Regulations are 
applicable.  
Flash title transactions 
A supplier may elect to apply the zero rate when the movable goods are supplied on a “flash 
title” basis. The term “flash title” refers to a situation in which movable goods are supplied to 
a qualifying purchaser and that person immediately supplies the same goods to another 
qualifying purchaser. 161 Ownership of the goods therefore vests in the first qualifying 
purchaser only for a moment before being sold to another qualifying purchaser. 
Example 30 – Flash title transactions 
BF supplies granite, which is delivered to BB on board a ship situated within the Coega Port 
in Port Elizabeth (Gqeberha) (free on board – also known as FOB). BB on-sells the granite to 
various customers, also subject to FOB delivery on board the same ship. BF as the title owner 
of the granite up to and until the granite is delivered and loaded onto the designated vessel, 
bears all of the associated costs and risks for the supply of the granite. Once the granite has 
been loaded onto the vessel (delivered under FOB) the title, costs and risk passes from BF to 
BB and immediately from BB to its various customers. 
Result: 
From the above scenario it is clear that the ownership of the goods supplied by BF to BB vests 
in BB for only a moment before the same goods are subsequently sold by BB  to its various 
customers. Furthermore, the supply of the goods between BF to BB will be zero-rated as well 
as the supply of the goods between BB to the various customers. 
 
159  See regulation 6(6) of the Export Regulations. 
160 See regulation 5 of the Export Regulations. 
161 A qualifying purchaser in respect of “flash title” transactions is defined in paragraph ( f) of the 
definition of a “qualifying purchaser”. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 107 
Movable goods subject to further processing, repair, improvement etc 
A supplier may elect to apply the zero  rate when movable goods are supplied to a qualifying 
purchaser but delivered to another vendor in the RSA for further work such as processing, 
repair, improvement, manufacture, assembly or alteration to be carried out under a contract 
between the qualifying purchaser and the vendor concerned. The vendor that carries out the 
further work must ensure that the movable goods are delivered to a designated harbour or 
airport once the further work is completed, and that the r elevant export documentation is 
obtained. In this case, the supplier must obtain and retain additional documents from the 
vendor responsible for carrying out the further work. See  Part Two – Section A of the Export 
Regulations for a list of the additional documentation required. 
Other supplies 
A supplier may elect to apply the zero rate on the supply of movable goods to a qualifying 
purchaser or registered vendor if such goods were delivered to either the port authority, master 
of the ship, a container operator, the pilot of an aircraft, or were brought within the control area 
of the airport authority, are situated at the designated harbour or airport and are destined to 
be exported from the RSA. 
Example 31 – Other supplies 
Facts: 
ABC (Pty) Ltd sells movable goods on an FOB basis to a qualifying purchaser (XYZ Merchants 
Ltd) situated in China. The movable goods have already received the necessary customs 
clearance and are ready for export as the goods were delivered on board the named vessel 
at the Durban harbour.  
Result: 
ABC (Pty) Ltd may elect to levy VAT at the zero rate on the sale of the movable goods to XYZ 
Merchants Ltd on the basis that the supplier ensured that the goods were delivered to the 
vessel concerned which was situated at the Durban harbour (being a designated harbour) and 
from where the goods will be exported. 
Part Two – Section B 
Indirect exports by road or rail were not accommodated under the previous VAT Export 
Incentive Scheme. Part Two Section B of the Export Regulations provide for a supplier to elect 
to supply movable goods to a qualifying purchaser at the zero  rate where the goods are 
exported by road or rail subject to specific requirements that must be met by the relevant 
parties.  
After collection, the goods must be stored and consolidated by the agent in a warehouse until 
the consolidated consignment of goods is exported to the qualifying purchaser in the export 
country.162 In such a case, the various suppliers may elect to zero -rate the supply of such 
goods provided, amongst others, that the qualifying purchaser is registered as an “exporter” 
under the Customs and Excise Act. The agent and the cartage contractor who are responsible 
for removing the goods, either inland or to the export country, must be licensed as removers 
of goods in bond as contemplated in the Customs and Excise Act. 
 
162 The goods must be exported within 90 days as contemplated in Part Three. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 108 
In order to apply the zero rate in respect of the supply of movable goods, the supplier and the 
agent must obtain and retain sufficient documentary proof as contemplated in Part Two – 
Section B of the Export Regulations. 
Lastly, this Part makes provision for the supply of certain lubricating oils and greases to be 
zero-rated by the manufacturers thereof in the oil and gas industry where such goods are 
exported by road or rail by the qualifying purchaser or its cartage contractor. For the zero rate 
to apply in this case, the relevant documentary requirements as set out in this Part  must be 
met. 
Part Three 
This Part sets out the time period within which movable goods must be exported from the 
Republic as well as the time period within which the required documentary proof must be 
obtained. Generally, goods must be exported within 90 days from the earlier of t he time an 
invoice is issued or the time any payment of consideration is received by the supplier. The 
general rule is subject to certain exceptions. For example, when the goods must be 
manufactured or assembled, the goods have to be exported within 90  days from the date of 
completion of the process. See Part Three of the Export Regulations for further exceptions. 
As a general rule, documentary proof that the goods were exported must also be obtained 
within 90 days from the date that the goods are required to be exported. Provision is made for 
the Commissioner to extend the period within which the proof of payment must be obtained in 
certain exceptional and limited circumstances. 
If the supplier is unable to obtain the required documentary proof within the prescribed period, 
the supplier must account for output tax in respect of the supply in field 12 of the VAT return 
in the tax period in which the prescribed period ends. If the s upplier receives the 
documentation within a period of five years from the end of the tax period during which the 
original tax invoice for the supply should have been issued, the supplier may deduct the 
amount of output tax previously calculated as an adjus tment in field 18 of the VAT return for 
the tax period in which this documentation is received, provided that certain requirements are 
met.163 
For more information see the Export Regulations on the SARS website or the VRA pamphlet 
which is available at all of South Africa’s International Airports or the VRA’s website 
www.taxrefunds.co.za. 
12.1.3 Second-hand goods 
Direct exports 
Under the proviso to section 11(1), the zero rate cannot apply where second-hand goods are 
acquired by the supplier and subsequently exported after notional input tax has been deducted 
on the acquisition thereof (see Chapter 8). In such a case, the supplier must levy VAT equal 
to the notional input tax originally deducted on the acquisition of the goods now being 
exported. Should the second -hand goods be acquired from a registered vendor under a 
taxable supply, a normal input t ax deduction may be available to the recipient, provided the 
relevant documentary proof is obtained and retained. In this case the normal rules apply and 
the subsequent export of those second-hand goods may be subject to VAT at the zero-rate. 
 
163 See Part Three of the Export Regulations. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 109 
Indirect exports 
VAT is levied at the standard rate on the indirect export of goods. When second-hand movable 
goods are exported and a notional input tax deduction has been made by the supplier on the 
acquisition of those goods, the VRA may not refund the amount of the not ional input tax 
deduction to the qualifying purchaser. For example, when a non-resident purchases a second-
hand motor vehicle from a motor car dealer in the RSA, that non-resident will only be able to 
claim a refund to the extent that the VAT charged excee ds the amount of notional input tax 
deducted by the motor car dealer.164 
In the case of second -hand goods which were originally acquired from another registered 
vendor before being exported and a normal input tax deduction supported by a tax invoice 
was made, the full amount of VAT charged may be refunded (less the VRA’s commis sion). 
The reason is that the supplier would not have deducted a notional input tax credit on the 
acquisition of those second-hand goods. 
Example 32 – Second-hand goods – direct export 
Facts: 
DEF, being an art gallery, buys a second -hand painting for R11 500 from a non-vendor and 
claims a notional input tax deduction of R1  500 (R11 500 × 15 / 115). DEF sells the painting 
to M from Botswana for R15  847,83 and delivers it to M’s  address in Botswana. The locally 
advertised price is R16 500 (including R2 152,17 VAT). 
Result: 
The calculation of the selling price is as follows:  R 
Selling price excluding VAT (R16 500 × 100 / 115)   14 347,83 
VAT (equal to the notional input tax deducted by DEF)     1 500,00 
Selling price including VAT    15 847,83 
VAT levied at the standard rate is equal to the amount of notional input tax deducted. The tax 
invoice issued to M must either show that VAT of R1 500 has been charged or that the selling 
price includes VAT of R1 500. M is not entitled to a refund of the R1 500 VAT charged. 
 
Example 33 – Second-hand goods – indirect export 
Facts: 
Assume the same facts in Example 32, except that M buys the painting at the normal price 
advertised (R16 500 including R2 152,17 VAT) and that he collects the painting in the RSA 
and exports it in person.   
 
 
164 The Export Regulations require that the tax invoice complies with the requirements in section 20(4). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 110 
Result: 
To assist M to obtain a refund from the VRA, at the time of export, the tax invoice should show 
the following: 
 R 
Selling price including VAT @ 15% 16 500,00 
VAT Refund 
Total VAT charged (R16 500 ×15 / 115) 2 152,17 
Less notional input tax deducted (1 500,00) 
VAT refundable   652,17 
The tax invoice must contain a full and proper description of the goods supplied (indicating, 
when applicable, that the goods are second -hand goods). A refund will not be authorised if 
these details are not clearly indicated on the face of the tax invoice. Only the VAT in exce ss 
of the notional input tax deducted can be refunded by the VRA, (that is, R6 52,17 less the 
VRA’s commission), whereas the portion of the VAT equal to the notional input tax credit 
deducted (R1 500) is not refundable.  
12.2 Importation of goods 
12.2.1 General 
VAT is payable on the importation into the RSA of goods purchased from a supplier in another 
country, subject to certain exemptions. Goods may only be imported through one of the 43 
designated commercial ports (as listed in 12.1). The VAT on importation must be paid to SARS 
by the vendor importing the goods or services or the vendor’s clearing agent. The VAT paid 
to SARS Customs on goods imported by a vendor in the course of making taxable supplies 
may be deducted as input tax by the vendor, subject to certain requirements. 
12.2.2 Input tax on imported goods 
From 1 April 2015, the VAT Act165 has been amended to the effect that the VAT payable on 
importation of goods by a vendor may only be deducted during the tax period when the goods 
are released under the Customs and Excise Act.  
For purposes of deducting the VAT paid on the importation of goods, the vendor making the 
deduction must be in possession of the following documentation: 
• An “EDI Customs Status 1 Release Message”. 
• A valid bill of entry or other document prescribed by the Customs and Excise Act (for 
example, form SAD 500 and/or any additional SAD document that might be required). 
• The receipt number for the payment of such tax, that is the receipt issued on eFiling. 
In respect of goods imported on or after 1  April 2015 where the goods are imported by an 
agent acting on behalf of the vendor (being the principal), and the bill of entry or such other 
document prescribed by the Customs and Excise Act is held by the agent,  the agent must 
furnish the vendor with a statement within 21  days of the end of the calendar month during 
which the goods were imported, containing the following particulars:166 
• The full and proper description of the goods. 
 
165  See sections16(3)(a)(iii) and 16(3)(b)(ii). 
166 See section 54(3)(b). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 111 
• The quantity or volume of the goods. 
• The value of the goods. 
• The amount of tax paid and the receipt relating to the payment of such tax, that is the 
receipt number issued on eFiling for such payment. 
The vendor must be in possession of the aforementioned statement at the time the VAT return 
containing the deduction is submitted to SARS. Furthermore, in addition to furnishing the 
statement, the agent must maintain sufficient records to enable the name, the address and 
VAT registration number of the vendor to be ascertained.  
Deferment facility 
SARS Customs officers control the entry of goods into the country, and goods will not be 
released before they have been declared and any customs and/or excise duties (if any) and 
VAT have been paid thereon. Regular importers or their clearing agents can, however, enquire 
about obtaining access to a deferment facility at SARS Customs branch offices. This facility 
allows the importer a credit facility with SARS for a specified amount for the customs duty and 
VAT payable on the importation of goods into the RS A. (The facility may not be used for the 
payment of excise duty or fuel levy.)  
Application for this facility can be made by completing forms DA650 (registration particulars of 
applicant) and DA652 (agreement between the applicant and SARS). A bank guarantee or 
surety must also be lodged with SARS to secure any potential tax liability  which may arise 
during the period that the deferred payment arrangement may be allowed. The amount of the 
security is based on the inherent risks of the business and type of goods to be imported. 
12.2.3 Imports from countries other than Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia or Swaziland147F 
(eSwatini) (the BLNS countries) 
The BLNS countries together with the RSA form the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). 
VAT, customs duty and in some cases, excise duty is payable on goods imported from outside 
the SACU region, (that is, from non-BLNS countries), and is calculated as follows: 
Customs Duty Value (CV) 
+ Customs duty (and Excise duty) if applicable (non-rebated duties) 
+ 10% of the Customs Duty Value 
= Added Tax Value (ATV) 
ATV × 15% = VAT payable 
The 10% upliftment is not an amount payable to SARS, but represents an amount in lieu of 
transport and insurance costs which is used for calculating the ATV. The 10% upliftment does 
not apply in the case of imports from BLNS countries (see 12.2.4). 
Example 34 – Importation of goods 
Facts: 
C imports a painting from Uganda and pays R5 000 for it. Customs duty is levied at 25%. 
 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 112 
Result: 
Upon being cleared for home consumption, VAT will be calculated as follows: 
 R 
Purchase price/customs value 5 000 (CV) 
+ Customs duty (@ 25% of CV)  1 250 
+ 10% upliftment (@ 10% of CV) 500 
Value for importation and VAT purposes 6 750 (ATV) 
VAT at 15%  1013 
12.2.4 Imports from the BLNS countries 
Goods that are imported from within the SACU region (that is, from BLNS countries) are not 
subject to customs duties and the 10% upliftment in value is not applied if the goods have their 
origin in a BLNS country. However, VAT is still payable on the impor tation of the goods into 
the RSA at the standard rate  on the value for customs purposes, unless the goods are 
specifically exempt from VAT on importation. The ATV in the case of imports from BLNS 
countries will therefore not include any customs duties or the 10% upliftment in the customs 
value as shown in 12.2.3.  
12.2.5 Exclusions 
No VAT is payable on the importation of certain goods. These exemptions are listed in 
Schedule 1 to the VAT Act. Some examples are – 
• goods imported for diplomats and other foreign representatives; 
• goods imported by immigrants, tourists, returning residents and other passengers for 
personal use, for example – 
➢ visitor’s personal effects, sporting and recreational equipment which will be 
used during their stay in the RSA; 
➢ returning resident’s personal effects, sporting and recreational equipment 
exported for use abroad and subsequently re-imported; 
➢ wine, cigarettes, perfume and certain other new or used goods, being gifts or 
items for personal use (within certain limits) imported as part of a passenger’s 
baggage; 
➢ household furniture and other household effects imported by natural persons 
for own use on change of residence to the RSA; 
• goods which are re-imported in certain circumstances; 
• goods temporarily admitted for processing, repair, cleaning, reconditioning or for the 
manufacture of goods exclusively for export;  
• goods temporarily admitted subject to exportation in the same state;  
• goods donated by a non -resident to an association not for gain, public authority or 
municipality which are not for resale, and which are imported for use exclusively for 
educational or welfare purposes; educational, medical or scientific research; or for 
issue to indigent persons at no charge; and 
• goods imported which are subsequently lost, destroyed or damaged through natural 
disasters or under such circumstances as the Commissioner deems exceptional. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 113 
A provisional payment or bond will normally be required to secure the amount of VAT payable 
on the importation of goods that are temporarily imported into the RSA or removed in transit 
through the RSA. This is to ensure that the risk of the goods remaining in the RSA without the 
payment of the applicable VAT is covered. When the goods leave the country, the provisional 
payment may be refunded, or the bond released. 
12.3 Imported services 
VAT is levied at the standard rate on the supply of “imported services” (see 12.3.1), subject to 
any exemptions which may apply under section  14(5) (see  12.3.5). The recipient of the 
imported services is responsible for the declaration and payment of the VAT. Such supplies 
are only subject to VAT if the definition of “imported services” is met. 
12.3.1 What is an imported service? 
An imported service is – 
• a supply of services; 
• made by a supplier who is not a resident of the RSA, or who carries on a business 
outside the RSA;  
• to a recipient who is a resident of the RSA; 
• to the extent that such services are utilised or consumed in RSA for non -taxable 
purposes. 
Should the value of any particular supply exceed R100, the recipient is required to pay VAT 
on importation to SARS if the services are acquired wholly or partly for non-taxable purposes. 
A person acquiring electronic services from a non -resident is required to declare VAT on 
imported services, unless the non-resident supplier is registered as a vendor in the RSA. If no 
VAT is charged and the supplier is not registered as a vendor, VAT on i mported services is 
payable. 
See Example 36 and Chapter 2 for more information. 
Examples of when a resident recipient has to account for VAT on imported services are where 
the recipient – 
• is not a registered vendor; 
• is a vendor, but the services are wholly or partly for making exempt supplies; or 
• is a vendor, but the services are applied for private purposes. 
Example 35 – Imported services definition 
ABC (a VAT vendor), manufactures ball valves and pays a technical license fee to a company 
in the United Kingdom. The service is accordingly supplied by a supplier who is not a resident 
of the RSA to a resident (ABC). However, as the services are wholly consumed in the course 
of making taxable supplies (that is, manufacturing and selling ball valves), the services are not 
“imported services” as defined in the Act. VAT would not be payable by ABC on the services 
supplied by the non-resident. 
 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 114 
Example 36 – Imported services vs enterprise (digital products / electronic services) 
Facts: 
BDE orders an electronic version of the latest cookbook from XYZ (an internet-based business 
located in Belgium) and downloads the cookbook onto an electronic tablet. BDE pays €60 for 
the book by way of a credit card transaction.  
Result: 
These “services” are supplied by a non-resident (XYZ in Belgium) to a recipient (BDE) who is 
resident in the RSA for non-taxable (private) purposes, therefore VAT will be payable by BDE 
in this situation. Assuming that €60 was equivalent to R600 on the date of the importation and 
that XYZ was not liable for VAT registration in the RSA, the VAT payable on imported services 
would be calculated as follows: 
 VAT payable = R600 × 15% = R90 
From 1 June 2014, a non-resident supplier that provides certain electronic services to a South 
African resident is required to register for VAT subject to certain requirements 148F being met.167 
If the non-resident supplier of electronic services is required to be registered as a vendor, the 
supplies concerned are not regarded as imported services which are taxable under 
section 7(1)(c). Instead, the non -resident supplier, being a vendor, will charge VAT under 
section 7(1)(a), as taxable supplies made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise carried 
on by that non -resident in the RSA. The vendor can deduct the VAT paid as input tax if 
acquired for taxable purposes. 
12.3.2 When and how must VAT on imported services be paid? 
In the case of vendors, the VAT on imported services must be declared in field  12 of the 
VAT201 return and paid together with any other VAT which may be due for the tax period 
concerned in accordance with the manner set out in Chapter 10. Non-vendors must complete 
and retain form VAT215 and ensure that  payment is made  via eFiling  within 30  days of 
importing the services. Once the payment is successfully processed, eFiling will generate a 
receipt number which must be inserted in the relevant field on the VAT215 record. 
The VAT215 record and the invoices issued by the foreign supplier must be retained as 
relevant material by the recipient and must not be submitted to SARS for filing purposes. 
12.3.3 Time of supply 
The time of supply of imported services is the earlier of the time that an invoice is issued by 
the supplier or the recipient, or any payment is made by the recipient in respect of that supply. 
 
167 See 2.1.5 for more details on the supply of electronic services by non-resident suppliers and liability 
to register and account for VAT. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 12 
 
 115 
12.3.4 Value of supply 
The taxable value of the supply is the greater of the consideration or the OMV. 
Example 37 – Value of imported services 
Facts 
Z is an RSA resident (individual) who is not registered for VAT. Z engages the services of X, 
a non-resident attorney carrying on a business in the UK, to provide a legal opinion on a matter 
pertaining to a family matter. The consideration charged by X for  the legal services is £400 
(equivalent to R8 000). Had Z obtained the same services in the RSA, the open market value 
thereof would have been R9 000.  
Result: 
Z acquired the services from a non-resident business wholly for non-taxable purposes (private 
purposes). The services will therefore fall within the definition of “imported services” and VAT 
will be payable on the greater of the following amounts: 
 • the consideration payable to X, namely, R8 000; or 
 • the OMV of R9 000. 
Therefore, the VAT payable = R9 000 × 15% = R1 350 
12.3.5 Exceptions 
VAT is not payable on imported services where – 
• the supply would be exempt from VAT or zero-rated if the supply was made in the RSA;  
• the supply of the service is subject to VAT at the standard rate (currently 15%);  
• a supply is of an educational service by an educational institution established in an 
export country which is regulated by an educational authority in that export country;  
• the supply is of the services of a non -resident employee under an employment 
contract; or 
• the value of the imported services does not exceed R100 per invoice. 
Example 38 – Exempt imported services 
Facts: 
DFG enrols in an MBA distance learning programme offered by the University of Wales at a 
cost of £10 000 (assuming that this is the equivalent of R200 000).  
Result: 
In this situation, educational services are supplied by the University of Wales (a non-resident) 
to the recipient DFG (a resident of the RSA). The services are imported for non -taxable 
(private) purposes and therefore fall within the definition of “imported services”. However, the 
VAT Act makes provision for an exemption in this situation as the same educational services, 
if provided by any university in the RSA, would have been exempt from VAT under 
section 12(h). 
VAT is therefore not payable by the recipient DFG on the fees of R200  000 (the equivalent 
value in rands) in this case.

Chapter 13  
Tax invoices, debit- and credit notes 
13.1 Introduction 
The most important document in a VAT system is the tax invoice. Without a proper tax invoice 
or alternative documents approved by the Commissioner a vendor cannot deduct input tax on 
the purchases for the vendor’s enterprise, If the vendor has clients who are not vendors or 
you are selling goods to foreign tourists, they cannot claim back the VAT that you have 
charged them, or claim a refund of the V AT when taking the goods out of the country. The 
issuing of a tax invoice is an obligation on every vendor who makes taxable supplies in the 
course or furtherance of their enterprise and it is an integral part of the audit trail of a vendo r 
and its activities. Failure to issue tax invoices is therefore a contravention of the Act and 
vendors will be guilty of an offence.168 The TA Act requires all vendors to maintain records in 
their original form for example, tax invoices and for those records to be kept at a safe location. 
For more information on record keeping, see 16.5. 
The VAT Act identifies different transactions that each requires different types of tax invoices: 
(a) If the consideration for the supply is more than R5 000 (including tax), a full tax invoice 
must be issued. 
(b) If the consideration for the supply is less than R5 000 (including tax), an abridged tax 
invoice may be issued, except when that supply is a zero-rated supply.169 
(c) If the consideration for the supply is less than R50, a tax invoice does not have to be 
issued. 
(d) If the Commissioner is satisfied that it is impractical to issue a full tax invoice in respect 
of a particular transaction and that there are sufficient other records available, the 
Commissioner may direct that a tax invoice does not need to be issued or c ertain 
particulars need not be reflected on the tax invoice.1
170 
(e) If a vendor makes a supply of valuable metal to a recipient which is a registered vendor 
and the DRC applies.  
13.2 What is the difference between an invoice and a tax invoice? 
The VAT Act prescribes that a tax invoice must contain certain details about the taxable supply

13.4 Tax invoices prescribed under the DRC 
The requirements under 13.3 applies to the supply of valuable metal subject to the DRC with 
some additional requirements and exceptions. The supplier is required to issue a tax invoice 
with the following additional information173 clearly showing that: 
• The supply is subject to the DRC. 
• The VAT charged on the supply must not be included in the amount shown as due by 
the recipient, that is, no VAT charge must be shown on the tax invoice issued. 
• A statement that the amount of VAT charged must be accounted for and paid (on behalf 
of the supplier) by the recipient. 
These requirements also apply to recipients of a supply of valuable metal where the recipient 
of the supply, being a registered vendor, has been granted approval to issue recipient created 
tax invoices as discussed under 13.5. 
The recipient vendor must also issue a statement containing the prescribed details in writing 
to the vendor that supplied the valuable metal within 21  days from the end of the calendar 
month during which the VAT on the supply of valuable metal has been accounted and paid for 
by the recipient vendor. The statement must contain, amongst others, the following particulars: 
• The tax invoice number. 
• The value of the DRC supplies. 
• Full and proper description of the valuable metal. 
• Confirmation that the VAT charged by the supplier was accounted for and paid to 
SARS by reflecting the applicable tax period and payment reference number (this 
number is generated by SARS regardless of whether the return for the tax period 
results in a payment due by or a refund due to the recipient) issued by SARS. 
The following important points should also be noted with regard to tax invoices: 
• A vendor must issue a tax invoice to the recipient within 21 days of the supply having 
been made for which the consideration for the supply exceeds R50 (whether the 
recipient has requested this or not). This also applies when the vendor’s agent issues 
the tax invoice on behalf of the vendor.174 
• If the consideration in money for the supply is R50 or less, a tax invoice is not required. 
However, a document such as a till slip or sales docket indicating the VAT charged by 
the supplier will be required to confirm the output tax declared and verify the input tax 
deducted. 
• A tax invoice must be in South African currency, except for a zero -rated supply (for 
example, goods exported) or in the case of certain supplies of electronic services by 
non-resident suppliers.175 A full tax invoice (see  the example on the previous page) 
must be issued in respect of zero-rated supplies, even if the consideration is less than 
R5 000. A full tax invoice must indicate the recipient’s VAT registration number (if that 
person is a vendor). 
 
173  Regulation 4 of the DRC Regulations 
174 Section 54, as amended with effect from 1 April 2015. 
175 See BGR 11 “Use of an Exchange Rate” for more information. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 13 
 
 120 
• A BGR has been published to set out, amongst others the information to be contained 
on a tax invoice, debit or credit note to be issued by electronic service suppliers. 
See GN 1594 in GG 45324 dated 10 December 2021  and BGR 28 “Electronic 
Services” for more information. 
• The use of acceptable documentary proof instead of tax invoices is set out in 
BGR 36 “Circumstances Prescribed by the Commissioner for the Application of 
Section 16(2)(g)”. See 8.1. 
• The further particulars required in relation to a deemed supply of goods repossessed 
or surrendered under an ICA is prescribed in BGR 63 “Further Particulars Prescribed 
by the Commissioner under Section 20(8A)(c)”.  
• In a case where a person’s VAT registration is backdated and certain supplies were 
received before the registration date , the requirement for the VAT number of the 
recipient to be reflected on the tax invoice will not apply. As a result, the tax invoices 
received for any supplies made to that vendor before the date of registration may still 
be considered as valid proof for input tax documentary requirements. 
13.5 Documents prepared by the recipient (self-invoicing) 
13.5.1 Tax Invoices, credit notes and debit notes 
In some instances , the consideration for a supply is determined by the recipient of the 
goods/services rather than by the supplier. An example of this is where a farmer (the supplier) 
takes produce to a co-operative which will only be sold at a later stage, once the quality  and 
quantity of the produce has been determined. Since the price that will eventually be obtained 
for the goods depends on factors outside the farmer’s control, the farmer is not in a position 
to issue an invoice or tax invoice for the produce when it is delivered for sale. 
In such cases, SARS may permit the co-operative (recipient) to issue the tax invoices and any 
debit- and credit notes relating to supplies instead of the supplier. This is referred to as 
“recipient-created invoicing” or “self-invoicing”. 
13.5.2 Binding General Ruling 15 
Binding General Ruling  15 “Recipient -Created Tax Invoices; Credit and Debit Notes”  
(BGR 15)176 essentially grants approval to recipient vendors to apply what is commonly known 
as “self-invoicing” where the recipient determines the consideration for the supply of the goods 
or services and is in control of determining the quantity or quality of the supply, or is 
responsible for measuring or testing the goods sold by the supplier. B GR 15 provides that in 
such cases, the recipient may issue any tax invoices, credit and debit notes for the supplies 
concerned instead of the supplier. This is on condition that the parties to the transaction 
comply with the requirements set out in BGR 15.  
Vendors that want to apply self -invoicing procedures but are unable to comply with the 
requirements stipulated in BGR 15 will have to obtain written authorisation from SARS before 
they will be allowed to apply this method of invoicing or creating credit an d debit notes. 
See Chapter 15, for more information on ruling applications. 
 
176 Read with Interpretation Note 56 “Recipient-Created Tax Invoices, Credit and Debit Notes”. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 13 
 
 121 
Note that approval for self-invoicing procedures will not be granted if the purpose is merely to 
facilitate the obtaining of a tax invoice, credit or debit note by the recipient. Approval will only 
be granted in the case of those industries and transactions where an effective self -invoicing 
system has traditionally been followed in the past. 
The written application to apply self-invoicing must contain – 
• a description of the nature of the businesses respectively carried on by the supplier 
and the recipient; 
• a full description of the transactions in respect of which self-invoicing is required; 
• details of the existing invoicing procedures being followed for such transactions; and 
• an undertaking by the recipient that they will comply with the administrative 
requirements with regard to tax invoices, debit or credit notes. The applicant must also 
obtain and retain the written agreement of each affected supplier in this regard 
(vendors) as well as their written confirmation that they will comply with the said 
administrative requirements. 
The ruling application must also include any other documents as set out in the VAT Rulings 
Process Reference Guide which may be necessary to meet the requirements for a ruling 
application. 
13.6 Tax invoices for mixed supplies 
As mentioned in 13.3, a full tax invoice must be issued in respect of a zero-rated supply. There 
may, however, be a situation where various supplies are made by the same supplier and 
where each supply is treated differently for VAT purposes. Should this occur, the tax invoice  
must clearly distinguish between the various supplies and indicate separately the applicable 
values, and the tax charged (if any) on each supply. 
Example 41 below shows an example of a tax invoice for taxable and non -taxable (mixed) 
supplies.

13.7 Special cases 
Although the general rule is that a vendor must have a tax invoice before being allowed to 
deduct any input tax in relation to the supply, there are a few exceptions to the rule which are 
discussed below. 
13.7.1 Second-hand goods 
The VAT Act allows a vendor under certain circumstances to deduct input tax on the 
acquisition of second-hand goods. In order to substantiate the deduction, the vendor has to 
obtain and retain a declaration from the supplier of such goods confirming that such supply is 
not a taxable supply in addition to maintaining the following records: 
• A signed VAT264 declaration, which includes the following information: 
➢ Name, address and ID no. of the supplier (ID no. of the representative person 
if it is a company or CC) 
➢ Quantity or volume of goods 
➢ Full description of the goods 
➢ Consideration for the supply 
➢ Proof of payment (including the date of payment) 
➢ Declaration by the supplier stating that the supply is not a taxable supply 
 
177 VAT charged @ 15% as the tourist will remove the goods from the RSA himself.  
178 VAT = R1 000+ R10 000 + R5 000 = R16 000 × 15% = R2 400. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 13 
 
 123 
• For all supplies, the vendor must obtain and retain a copy of the supplier’s identity 
document/identity card in the case of a natural person and, in the case of a company 
or CC, a business letterhead or similar document is also required which shows the 
name and registration number allocated by the Registrar of Companies. In the case of 
a vendor not being able to obtain the required documents, alternative documents may 
be obtained in certain circumstances.  
Important Note 
The VAT264 declaration has been designed specifically to assist vendors to comply with the 
law. Changes have been made to the VAT264 declaration to facilitate easier and simpler 
completion. 
The form must therefore be completed and maintained as part of the vendor’s records for VAT 
purposes for the prescribed record-keeping period. 
13.7.2 Repossession or surrender of goods supplied under an instalment credit 
agreement 
It is impractical in circumstances where goods supplied under an ICA are subsequently 
repossessed or where such goods are surrendered by the debtor, to require the debtor to 
issue an invoice or tax invoice to the financier. Therefore, if the goods – 
• are repossessed from, or surrendered by, a vendor, the person exercising the right of 
repossession (normally a bank or other financier who is also a vendor), is required to 
create and furnish a tax invoice to the debtor; and 
• are repossessed from, or surrendered by, a non -vendor, before 5 January 2023 the 
person exercising the right of repossession, namely the vendor , is required to obtain 
the particulars specified under section 20(8A).  
Due to the hostile nature of repossession and surrender, the debtor is often reluctant to 
cooperate and there was difficulty in obtaining a signed VAT264 declaration from the debtor. 
In addition, because no actual payment occurred, no proof of payment existed. As a r esult, 
section 20(8A) was introduced deal specifically with documentary requirements in connection 
with the repossession and surrender of goods under an ICA. 
The creditor is no longer required to obtaining a signed VAT264 declaration and must now 
instead obtain the following information in order to deduct notional input tax: 
• The date on which the goods were repossessed or surrendered. 
• The name of the supplier. 
• A description of the goods. 
• The consideration for the supply. 
• Further particulars in the form and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe. 
See BGR 63, which sets out the further particulars prescribed by the Commissioner under the 
new section 20(8A)(c).  
For further information on this topic see the article “Documentary requirements for 
repossession and surrender of goods” in VAT Connect (Issue 16).  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 13 
 
 124 
13.7.3 Tax invoices issued and received by a vendor who has purchased an enterprise 
Under section 20(5A) a vendor acquiring an enterprise from another vendor and the selling 
vendor ceases its business operations as a result of the sale of the enterprise, the vendor 
acquiring the enterprise may issue and receive tax invoices in respect of the acquired 
enterprise and the tax invoice can reflect the details of the supplying vendor for a period of six 
months from the date of acquiring the enterprise. 
13.7.4 Other cases 
Should the Commissioner be satisfied that there will be sufficient records, and that it will be 
impractical for a tax invoice to be issued, permission may be granted to the supplier179 that tax 
invoices are not required to be issued, or that the information on the tax invoice may vary from 
the standard requirements. Should a supplier be permitted by the Commissioner to issue such 
alternative document, the recipient of the supply will be permitted to use that document to 
deduct input tax. See BGR 27 and Interpretation Note 83 “Application of Sections 20(7) and 
21(5)” for more information. 
Should the tax invoice for taxable supplies made to the vendor be held by the vendor’s agent, 
the vendor must be in possession of a statement furnished to him by the agent containing 
certain particulars about the supplies made to the vendor. 
An agent must furnish such statement within 21 days of the end of the calendar month during 
which the goods were supplied. Further, the agent is required to maintain sufficient records to 
enable the name, address and VAT registration number of the vendor to be ascertained. 
A vendor seeking to substantiate a deduction of input tax or other deductions based on 
alternative documentary proof must, obtain a ruling from the Commissioner as well as show 
that the vendor has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the prescribed documents .180 
See Chapter 8 for more information. 
13.8 Debit- and credit notes 
13.8.1 Introduction 
Debit- and credit notes must be issued in certain instances. For example, a debit note will be 
issued by the supplier when the tax invoice for the supply has already been issued and the 
previously agreed consideration is subsequently increased. Conversely, a cre dit note will be 
issued by the supplier when the tax invoice for the supply has already been issued and the 
previously agreed consideration is subsequently reduced. A credit note is also issued by the 
original supplier when faulty goods are returned by the customer. Note that it is illegal to issue 
more than one tax invoice per taxable supply. Another tax invoice may therefore not be issued 
to alter the consideration in respect of an original tax invoice issued. 
13.8.2 When must debit- and credit notes be issued? 
The following events trigger the need for a vendor to issue a debit note or credit note: 
• A supply of goods or services is cancelled. 
• The nature of the supply of goods or services has been fundamentally varied or altered. 
 
179 Section 20(7). 
180 Section 16(2)(g). The Commissioner may now consider alternative documentary proof to 
substantiate a deduction in certain cases.  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 13 
 
 125 
• The previously agreed consideration for the supply of the goods or services is altered 
by agreement with the recipient (including a discount). 
• Part of, or all the goods or services supplied are returned to the supplier (including any 
returnable container returned to the supplier). 
• The price on the tax invoice was either overstated or understated.  The supplier must 
make an adjustment in calculating the tax payable in the return for the tax period during 
which it has become apparent that the output tax is incorrect. 
Should any of the above circumstances apply and the supplier has  issued a tax invoice in 
which the tax charged is incorrect, a  debit or credit note must be issued, whether or not the 
supplier accounts for tax on an invoice or payments basis.  
A credit note is not required – 
• when a prompt payment (settlement) discount is the reason for the reduction in the 
consideration, provided the terms of that discount are clearly shown on the tax 
invoice;181 
• when rounding the total amount due on the sale of goods or services to the nearest 
circulated coin when returning change for cash transactions (rounding difference) and 
the adjusted amount is reflected on the tax invoice , subject to the certain conditions  
(see 9.5 and BGR 65 for more information; or 
• when the reduction in the consideration is due to a rounding difference and the 
adjusted amount is reflected on the tax invoice. See BGR 65 for more information. 
13.8.3 What details must appear on debit- and credit notes? 
The following details should appear on debit- and credit notes: 
• The words “debit note” or “credit note” (as the case may be). 
• The name, address,182 and VAT registration number of the vendor. 
• The name and address of the recipient (unless the supplier originally issued an 
abridged tax invoice). 
• The date on which the debit note or credit note is issued. 
• The amount by which the value of the supply and the VAT charged has been altered 
(or where the tax invoice reflected only the total consideration and a statement 
regarding the rate of tax applied, the amount by which the consideration has been 
reduced must be reflected and either the difference in VAT or a statement that the 
adjustment includes an amount of tax and the rate of the tax included). 
• A brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the debit or credit note. 
• Sufficient information to identify the transaction to which the debit or credit note refers 
for example, a reference to the original tax invoice number and the date on which it 
was issued. 
Below is an example of a credit note and a debit note. 
 
181  See also BGR 5 “Discounts, Rebates and Incentives in the Motor Industry” and BGR 6 “Discounts, 
Rebates and Incentives in the Fast Moving Consumable Goods Industry” for more information.

 127 
Note 
If it is discovered that the cash relating to a transaction has been stolen or misappropriated, 
this does not entitle the vendor to issue a credit note and deduct input tax thereon. The VAT 
Act does not provide for a deduction or adjustment in such cases. 
13.8.4 Debit- and credit notes prescribed under the DRC Regulations 
The requirements under 13.8.3 applies to debit- and credit notes relating to the supply of 
valuable metal subject to the DRC with some additional requirements and exceptions. A debit- 
or credit note issued by a supplier  of valuable metal under the DRC must contain the following 
additional information183 clearly showing that – 
• the supply is subject to the DRC; 
• a statement that the increase in the VAT amount in the case of a debit note, that was 
previously accounted for and paid by the recipient must be accounted for and paid by 
such recipient; and 
• a statement that the decrease in the VAT amount in the case of a credit note, that was 
previously accounted for and paid by the recipient must be accounted for and deducted 
by such recipient in its VAT return. 
These requirements also apply to recipients of a supply of valuable metal where the recipient 
of the supply, being a registered vendor, has been granted approval to issue recipient created 
debit- and credit notes as discussed under 13.5. 
The increase or decrease in the value of the supply of valuable metal as a result of a debit- or 
credit note event, must be reported in Field 3 of the VAT201 return. In this regard, the normal 
time of supply rules under the VAT Act apply. 
13.9 Electronic tax invoices, debit- and credit notes, and records 
The VAT Act includes specific requirements on the issuing of tax invoices, debit - and credit 
notes, and the retention of these documents. Chapter 4 of the TA Act sets out the details of 
the person who must keep records, the general records that must be kept , the form in which 
these records must be kept (including electronic form) and the period for which they should 
be retained. The requirements to issue and retain documents are equally applicable to vendors 
that do “e-invoicing”.  
Vendors do not need prior approval from the Commissioner to implement e -invoicing. 
However, it should be noted that generally the electronic transmission 184 and retention of 
documents is regulated by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act  25 of 2002 
(ECT Act). See also sections 30 and 255 of the TA Act and the rules issued pursuant to these 
provisions. 
 
183 Regulation 5 to the DRC Regulations. 
184 This refers to the issuing of documents in electronic format. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 13 
 
 128 
SARS is not in a position to issue rulings or provide advice on whether any Electronic Data 
Interchange (EDI) systems or any other electronic communications meet the technical 
specifications of the ECT Act. As the National Department of Communications regulates the 
ECT Act, it is the competent authority to approach for advice in this regard. One of the matters 
where the Commissioner may reject an application for a ruling (see Chapter 15 and Public 
Notice 103) is when it concerns the technical requirements pertaining to electronic invoicing.  
See Chapter 16 for details regarding the retention of records.185 
The record keeping of documents has specific requirements. Upon the commencement of the 
TA Act, the Commissioner issued Public Notice 787: Electronic form of record keeping under 
section 30(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act, 2011 186 which regulates how records for tax 
purposes are to be retained in electronic form. In terms of this notice, a senior SARS official 
may authorise the retention of records in an alternative  form or  manner. This notice is, 
however, currently under review. 
Vendors wishing to implement an electronic system must ensure that they do not replace their 
existing paper -based documentary systems before ensuring that they meet all the 
requirements. 
 
  
 
185 No opinions or rulings are issued on EDI systems and the like, see paragraph 2.13 of GN 103 in 
GG 36119 of 8 February 2013 “Additional considerations in terms of section 80(2) of the TA Act. 
186 The Public Notice was published on 1 October 2012 in GG 35733 with immediate effect.

Chapter 14  
Assessments, objections and appeals 
14.1 Assessments 
14.1.1 Purpose of assessments 
Assessments are predominantly regulated by the TA Act, but the applicable provisions should 
be read together with the VAT  Act. An assessment is defined in the TA Act as the 
determination of the amount of a tax liability or refund either through a vendor’s self -
assessment or an assessment by SARS (administrative assessment). See  Chapter 8 of the 
Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 2011 for more details. 
14.1.2 Types of assessments 
The TA Act provides for four types of assessments: 
(a) Original assessment : The concept of an original assessment, that is, the first 
assessment in respect of a tax period, is defined to be a specific type of assessment. 
The TA Act provides that an original assessment exists in four circumstances, namely, 
where – 
• a return is submitted as a self -assessment, which includes the vendor’s 
calculations of tax payable or refundable, such return is regarded as the original 
assessment; 
• no return is required but a tax payment is made, the payment is regarded as 
the original assessment; 
• a return is submitted but does not include the vendor’s calculation of tax 
payable or refundable and SARS determines the tax liability by way of an 
original assessment; 
• a return is required and the vendor does not file a return, or no return is required 
and the vendor does not pay the tax required, SARS will then assess the vendor 
by way of an original assessment based on an estimate.  The making of an 
estimated assessment does not detract from the obligation to submit a return , 
or the relevant material.187 
(b) Additional assessment: SARS will issue an additional assessment if any assessment 
does not reflect the correct application of a tax Act to the prejudice of SARS or the 
fiscus. An additional assessment replaces the original or latest assessment and will 
always be issued subsequent to that assessment. No additional assessments may be 
made if the previous assessment was made in accordance with a practice generally 
prevailing at the time.188 
 
187  See section 95 of the of the TA Act for more information on estimated assessments, including the 
conditions to be met before an objection or appeal may be accepted in respect of such 
assessments. This is explained in the summary of amendments in the Preface to this document. 
See also the Me morandum on the Objects of the Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill, 2021 
for a detailed discussion on recent amendments to sections 95 and 99 of the TA Act. 
188 See section 99(1)(d)(i) of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 130 
(c) Reduced assessment: A reduced assessment can only be issued in the following three 
instances: 
• An assessment is successfully disputed, a dispute is settled or a judgment is 
awarded and there is no right of further appeal. For example, an objection is 
allowed. 
• An error in the assessment is undisputed and readily apparent. The error can 
be on the part of SARS or the vendor. No objection or appeal is necessary to 
issue this type of assessment. 
• A senior SARS official is satisfied that the assessment was based on – 
➢ the failure by a third party or an employer to submit a return; 
➢ the incorrect return submitted by a third party or an employer; 
➢ a processing error by SARS; or 
➢ a return fraudulently submitted by a person who is not authorised by the 
vendor. 
No reduced assessment may be made if the previous assessment was made in 
accordance with a practice generally prevailing at the time.189 
(d) Jeopardy assessment : Jeopardy assessments, also known as protective 
assessments, may be issued in advance of the date on which the return is normally 
due in order to secure the collection of the tax that would otherwise be in jeopardy, or 
where there is some danger of tax be ing lost by the delay. A jeopardy assessment 
may, for instance, be issued before the date that a return is required where the vendor 
tries to place assets beyond the reach of SARS or where a tax debtor is about to leave 
the RSA and will leave behind a tax debt. When a review application has been made 
in the High Court in respect of a jeopardy assessment, SARS bears the burden of 
proving that the jeopardy assessment was reasonable in the circumstances. 
Assessment under section 31 of the VAT Act 
SARS may still make a determination of an amount of tax payable under section 31 where, for 
example, a person who is not registered as a vendor, supplies goods or services and 
represents that tax is charged on the supply, or where a vendor charges an incorrect amount 
of tax on a supply. In these circumstances SARS may issue a notice of assessment under 
section 31 for the amount of tax determined to be payable. 
The difference between an assessment and a notice of assessment 
An assessment is a determination of the amount of tax due or refundable either by way of self-
assessment by the taxpayer or by way of an assessment raised by SARS. When SARS raises 
an assessment, a notice of assessment will be issued to the taxpayer concerned in which the 
applicable tax liability or tax refund is indicated , including all of the details prescribed under 
section 96 of the TA Act. 
 
189 See section 99(1)(d)(ii) of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 131 
14.1.3 Other aspects 
The submission of a VAT return is considered to be an original self -assessment under the 
TA Act. The date of assessment is the date when the VAT return is submitted to SARS. If 
SARS reassesses a self-assessment, the date of assessment is the date on which the notice 
of the additional, reduced or jeopardy assessment is issued. 
The date of assessment is important because it is the date used to work out – 
• the period for record retention; and 
• the date after which SARS may not issue another assessment (subject to certain 
exceptions). 
See the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 2011  for more detailed information on 
assessments under the TA Act. 
14.2 Dispute resolution 
14.2.1 Tax Administration 
Vendors that are aggrieved by an assessment have a right to dispute it. Chapter 9 of the 
TA Act provides the legal framework for disputes, including VAT disputes. Chapter 9 must be 
read in addition to the rules issued under section 103 of the TA Act190 governing the following: 
• The procedures to lodge an objection and appeal against an assessment or decision 
that is subject to objection and appeal.191 
• Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures under which SARS and the person 
aggrieved by an assessment or decision may resolve a dispute.  
• The conduct and hearing of an appeal before a tax board or tax court. 
• Application on notice before a Tax Court. 
• Transitional rules. 
The new dispute resolution rules (the new rules), effective from 10  March 2023 were 
promulgated in Notice 3146 (GG 48188), which also repealed the previous dispute resolution 
rules under GN 550 in GG 37819 of 11 July 2014.  
Part G of the new rules contains transitional rules which provides that disputes not finalised at 
the commencement date of the new rules, that is, 10 March 2023, will generally be dealt with 
and finalised under the new rules. 
Burden of proof 
The burden of proof generally lies with the vendor in view of the fact that the assessment is 
essentially based on facts within the particular knowledge of the vendor. However, the 
TA Act192 provides that the burden of proof is on SARS to prove – 
• that an assessment based on an estimate is reasonable; and 
 
190 The new dispute resolution rules (the new rules), effective from 10 March 2023 were promulgated 
in Notice 3146 (GG 48188), which also repealed the previous dispute resolution rules under GN 550 
in GG 37819 of 11 July 2014.  
191 Section 104(2) of the TA Act. 
192 See section 102 of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 132 
• the facts on which an understatement penalty was imposed. 
It must also be noted that when the Commissioner authorises a jeopardy assessment, a 
vendor has the right to approach a High Court for review on the basis that the assessment is 
excessive or that there is no justification for the jeopardy assessment. In th e case of such a 
review application, SARS bears the burden of proving that the making of the assessment was 
reasonable in the circumstances.  
14.2.2 What to do if you dispute your tax assessment 
The dispute resolution process consists of the following aspects: 
• Obtaining reasons for an assessment 
• Objection to an assessment 
• Appeal against disallowance of an objection 
• ADR 
• Hearing at the Tax Court or Tax Board 
The obligation to pay a tax liability may be suspended for the duration of a dispute. This is 
dealt with in 14.3.10. 
14.2.3 Reasons for assessment 
An assessment for taxes owed should be accompanied by adequate grounds which explain 
why the assessment has been raised. If the statement of grounds are not adequate (or not 
included at all), you are entitled to request these reasons in writing within 30 business days 
from the date of the assessment. 
14.2.4 Objection to an assessment or decision 
You may lodge an objection if you have received an assessment and you do not agree that it 
is correct or your request for remission of a late payment penalty has been disallowed by 
SARS.193 With effect from 14 October 2016, a vendor can lodge an objection only on eFiling 
or by visiting a SARS branch. In the case that a request for remission of a late payment penalty 
was manually submitted before the said date, the vendor must lodge the notice of objection at 
a SARS branch. You must ensure that you have the relevant material to support the grounds 
for objection when you visit the SARS branch.  
The objection must – 
• be in a form prescribed by the Commissioner (DISP01 – Notice of Objection form) 194 
with the information requested in the form completed; 
• specify in detail the grounds upon which the objection is made; 
• specify an address where you will accept notice and delivery of SARS’s decision in 
respect of the objection;  
• be signed by you or your appointed representative; and 
 
193 Under the “pay now, argue later” rule, the obligation to pay tax, which arises upon the issue of an 
assessment, is not automatically suspended by an objection or appeal. A separate request for the 
suspension of payment must be made to SARS. See section 164 of the TA Act. 
194 With effect from 14 October 2016, the ADR 1 form is no longer accepted for lodging o bjections for 
VAT. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 133 
• be lodged within the prescribed period of 80 business days after the date of the 
assessment or decision or reasons for the assessment were furnished by the 
Commissioner (as the case may be). A vendor may apply for an extension of the period 
within which to lodge an objection. 
An objection that does not comply with the requirements may result in the objection not being 
entertained, and SARS may inform you by notice within 30  days that it is not accepted as a 
valid objection. However, you may within 20  days of delivery of the afo rementioned notice 
submit an amended objection. SARS will accept the amended objection if it complies with the 
requirements for a valid objection. 
An objection that is filed after the prescribed period has elapsed cannot be considered unless 
a senior SARS official has condoned the late filing of the objection. A request for condonation 
must be made at the same time as the objection is filed on the form DISP01 and it must contain 
an explanation for the delay. 
Under the TA Act, a senior SARS official may condone an objection that is filed up to 30 
business days 195 late, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the delay. If an 
objection is filed more than 30 business days late, then a senior SARS official must be satisfied 
that exceptional circumstances exist for the late filing. No objection can be entertained if it is 
filed after three years have passed from the date of the assessment. If the basis of an objection 
is that of a change to a practice generally prevailing, then an objection must be filed strictly in 
time as there are no grounds on which SARS can condone the late filing of such an objection. 
For further information, see  Interpretation Note 15 “Exercise of Discretion in Ca se of Late 
Objection or Appeal”. 
14.2.5 Request for further information 
Within 30 days from the date of delivery of your objection, the Commissioner may request that 
you provide additional substantiating documents that are required in order to make a decision 
regarding your objection. A vendor must deliver the requested documents within 30 days from 
the date of delivery of the notice by the Commissioner requesting such additional information. 
Upon request, and if reasonable grounds are submitted , the Commissioner may extend the 
period within which you should provide the additional information by an additional 20 days. 
14.2.6 Decision to allow, disallow or partially disallow the objection 
The Commissioner must, within 60 days from the receipt of your objection, or within 45  days 
from the date that you have delivered the requested further information, take a decision 
regarding the grounds of the objection. The decision can be either to disal low the objection, 
or allow it in full, or in part. In the event that the objection is partially disallowed, it should be 
clear which part of the objection relating to the assessment is being disallowed. 
14.2.7 Appeal against disallowance of an objection 
If you are dissatisfied with the decision of SARS following the objection, you may appeal 
against that decision. With effect from 14 October 2016, a vendor can lodge a notice of appeal 
only on eFiling or by visiting a SARS branch. In the case that a notice of objection was lodged 
before the said date by completing an ADR 1, the vendor must lodge the notice of appeal at a 
SARS branch. 
 
195 Section 104(5)(a) of the TA Act was amended with effect from 19 January 2017 to extend this period 
from 21 business days to 30 business days. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 134 
The appeal must – 
• be on the form prescribed by the Commissioner (DISP01 – Notice of Appeal form);196 
• be signed by you or your authorised representative; 
• indicate on which of the grounds specified in the objection you wish to appeal;  
• indicate whether you wish to make use of the ADR procedures or rather appeal to the 
Tax Board or Tax Court; and 
• be lodged within the prescribed period of 30 business days of receiving notice of 
SARS’s decision in respect of the objection. 
An appeal that is filed after the prescribed period has elapsed cannot be considered unless a 
senior SARS official has condoned the late filing of the appeal. A request for condonation must 
be made at the time the appeal is filed on the form DISP01 and it must contain an explanation 
for the delay. 
A senior SARS official may extend the period to lodge an appeal by up to – 
• 21 business days if satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for the delay; or 
• 45 business days if satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist for the delay.197  
Should the senior SARS official not extend the time within which an appeal must be lodged, a 
taxpayer may object to this ‘decision’ in the same way as an objection may be made against 
an assessment. 
14.2.8 After appeal has been noted 
You may request that your tax dispute with SARS be dealt with in one of the following ways: 
• By ADR, which is intended to be used where you and SARS agree to attempt to resolve 
a particular dispute outside of court.198 
• By the Tax Board, which has jurisdiction in respect of those matters where the total 
amount in dispute does not exceed R1 million.199 
• By the Tax Court, even where the total amount in dispute is less than R1  million. For 
example, where there is a legal principle in dispute. 
14.2.9 The office of the Tax Ombud 
The role of the Tax Ombud 
The office of the Tax Ombud reviews and addresses any complaint by a taxpayer regarding a 
service matter or a procedural or administrative matter arising from the application of a  
Tax Act by SARS. It is an independent, informal and simple mechanism, affording taxpayers 
 
196 With effect from 14  October 2016, the ADR  2 form is no longer accepted for lodging appeals for 
VAT. 
197 For further information, see Interpretation Note 15 “Exercise of Discretion In Case of Late Objection 
and Appeal”. 
198 Note that a willingness to participate in ADR is selected indicated by the taxpayer in the notice of 
appeal filed with SARS. 
199 The threshold amount for a matter to be referred to the Tax Board was increased from R500 000 to 
R1 million with effect from 1 January 2016. (See GN 1196 in GG 39490 of 17 December 2015). 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 135 
the opportunity to resolve legitimate complaints regarding administration, poor service delivery 
or a failure by SARS to recognise the rights of the taxpayer concerned. 
When may a taxpayer approach the Tax Ombud? 
A taxpayer with a complaint against SARS with regard to the administration of the law must 
first exhaust all of the internal administrative complaints resolution processes which 
commence at the SARS branch level. If the taxpayer is still dissatisfied, the complaint can be 
escalated to the SARS Complaints Management Office (CMO) and once all of these remedies 
are exhausted, the taxpayer can approach the office of the Tax Ombud. 
The decision of the Tax Ombud 
After considering the complaint, the Tax Ombud can only make a recommendation on the 
resolution of the complaint and both the taxpayer and the relevant SARS department must be 
duly informed. This recommendation is not binding on SARS or the taxpayer. 
The Tax Ombud cannot review the following matters: 
• Matters relating to legislation or tax policy. 
• SARS policy or practice generally prevailing, other than to the extent that it relates to 
a service matter or a procedural or administrative matter arising from the application 
of the provisions of a tax Act by SARS. 
• A matter against which an objection and appeal under a tax Act can be lodged, except 
for an administrative matter relating to such objection and appeal. 
• A decision of, or proceeding in or matter before the tax court. 
For more information on the role of the Tax Ombud see the Short Guide on Tax Administration 
Act, 2011. 
14.3 Alternative dispute resolution 
14.3.1 What is alternative dispute resolution? 
ADR is a form of dispute resolution that is quicker and more informal than litigation, or 
adjudication through the courts. ADR is, however, a voluntary process and both parties have 
to agree to the process before it can apply to the resolution of a dispute . Should you wish to 
make use of the ADR process, you must indicate this in your Notice of Appeal (NOA). SARS 
will then inform you within 30 business days of receipt of the NOA whether the matter is 
suitable for the ADR process, or not. The Commissioner may also initiate the ADR process by 
indicating to you within 30 business days from the receipt of the NOA, that the matter is 
appropriate for ADR. 
14.3.2 Who facilitates alternative dispute resolution? 
You can have party -to-party ADR discussions with SARS or use a facilitator for the ADR 
proceedings. Should the parties agree to a facilitator, SARS will appoint a n experienced 
person to facilitate the ADR proceedings. The person appointed may include a SARS official 
or any other person who is suitably qualified to carry out the duties. 
14.3.3 What ensures that alternative dispute resolution happens in a fair manner? 
The facilitator is bound by a Code of Conduct and must seek a fair, equitable, and legal 
resolution of the dispute. The process is also governed by a set of terms and conditions to 
which you agree. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 136 
14.3.4 The alternative dispute resolution process 
The process of ADR is as follows: 
• The ADR process is initiated either by you, or by SARS as mentioned in 14.3.1. 
• The facilitator will arrange an ADR meeting and notify all the parties. Where the parties 
have agreed not to appoint a facilitator, the parties themselves must arrange the ADR 
meeting.200 
• During the meeting both parties state their case and provide supporting documents. 
• During the process, the facilitator (if one is appointed) will endeavour to resolve the 
dispute between the parties. 
• The parties will either come to an agreement to settle the dispute, or decide on the way 
forward. 
14.3.5 Who represents you during the alternative dispute resolution process? 
You can represent yourself during the ADR (for example, the individual vendor, or the public 
officer in the case of a company). Alternatively, you may appoint another person to act on your 
behalf for example, if you require the assistance of your lawyer or  accountant during the 
proceedings. However, only in exceptional circumstances will you be permitted to be excused 
from the ADR proceedings for example, if you are in prison, or in hospital. 
14.3.6 Outcome of the alternative dispute resolution 
At the conclusion of the ADR process, the facilitator must record the terms of any agreement 
or settlement reached. If no agreement or settlement is reached, that fact must also be 
recorded. If an agreement or settlement is reached, it must be recorded and  signed by you 
and a SARS representative. SARS will issue, where necessary, a revised assessment to give 
effect to the agreement reached. In the event of the ADR process being unsuccessful, the 
unresolved dispute may be referred to the Tax Board or the Tax Court by the appellant within 
20 days of termination of the ADR proceedings, depending on the amount in dispute. 
14.3.7 Rights and obligations of parties 
You should at all times disclose all relevant facts during the ADR process. The ADR 
proceedings may not be electronically recorded. Representations made during the course of 
the ADR meetings are made without prejudice and may not be used against you in any  
subsequent proceedings. 
14.3.8 How long does alternative dispute resolution take? 
The ADR process must be concluded within 90 business days, or such further period that you 
and SARS may agree upon. 
14.3.9 What are the benefits of alternative dispute resolution? 
ADR is a less formal, more cost-effective and speedier method of dispute resolution. 
 
200 The meeting is conducted in an informal manner where both parties will state their case and provide 
evidence. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 14 
 
 137 
14.3.10  The “pay now, argue later” principle 
The principle that a vendor is required to pay taxes that are the subject of a dispute with SARS 
(commonly known as the “pay now, argue later” principle) is a long-standing one that has been 
affirmed by the highest court in the country and is now governed by the TA Act.201 
The obligation to pay tax is not automatically suspended by an objection or appeal but only 
upon specific request by the vendor. The suspension of payment of disputed tax is not an 
automatic right and a vendor must apply for the suspension, before a formal objection is 
lodged, in the form and manner prescribed by SARS. 
The following are some of the factors which SARS may consider in deciding on a vendor’s 
request to suspend payment of a disputed debt: 
• Whether the recovery of the disputed tax will be in jeopardy or there will be a risk of 
dissipation of assets. 
• The compliance history of the vendor.  
• Whether fraud is prima facie involved in the origin of the dispute. 
• Whether the vendor is able to provide adequate security for the payment of the amount 
involved. 
• Whether payment of the amount involved would result in irreparable financial hardship 
to the vendor not justified by the prejudice to SARS or the fiscus if the disputed tax is 
not paid or recovered. 
Should the payment of tax which the vendor intended to dispute be suspended before the 
lodging of an objection and subsequently – 
• no objection is lodged; 
• an objection is disallowed and no appeal is lodged; or  
• an appeal to the tax board or court is unsuccessful and no further appeal is noted, 
the suspension is revoked with immediate effect from the date of the expiry of the relevant 
prescribed time period or any extension of the relevant time period under the TA Act. 
As there is an inherent risk that the provision could be misused to delay payment, SARS may 
review and withdraw the suspension under specific circumstances. There may also be a 
suspension in the recovery proceedings by SARS during a suspension or revocation. See the 
Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 2011 for more details. 
Should a vendor request the remittance of an administrative non-compliance penalty, there is 
an automatic suspension of the duty to pay and SARS’s right to collect, which will run from the 
day the application is submitted until 21 business days after a dec ision is taken not to remit 
the administrative penalty. As with an application for the suspension of a disputed liability, the 
automatic suspension does not apply if there is a risk of a vendor not paying or if fraud was a 
factor in the underlying non-compliance. 
A vendor who pays disputed tax and whose objection or appeal is upheld, is entitled to interest 
from the date of payment of the disputed amount until the date on which such amount is 
refunded.

Chapter 15  
Rulings  
15.1 Introduction 
Since the introduction of VAT in 1991, provision has been made for the Commissioner to 
issue rulings regarding, amongst others, the VAT treatment of supplies and importations. 
The issuing of rulings was intended mainly to provide certainty to vendors regarding the VAT 
implications of transactions effected in the course of conducting an enterprise. In addition, it 
was intended to provide an assurance to the applican t that the ruling could be relied upon 
until withdrawn by the Commissioner, provided certain conditions were met.  
The introduction of the Advance Tax Ruling (ATR) legislation in 2006 had the effect of 
withdrawing all rulings previously issued by the Commissioner.202 Certain amendments had to 
be effected to the VAT Act to provide a legislative framework for the Commissioner to continue 
issuing binding rulings as well as a process to confirm rulings previously issued. The 
introduction of the TA Act resulted in all VAT class rulings and VAT rulings being issued under 
section 41B, read with Chapter 7 of the TA Act. 
The process for issuing a VAT ruling involves a number of steps, beginning with the 
submission of a VAT ruling application and ending with the issuing of a VAT ruling signed by 
a designated senior SARS official. For further information and guidelines on the VAT rulings 
process, including, amongst others, details on how to apply for a VAT ruling as well as the 
acceptable form and content of a VAT ruling application, see  the updated VAT Rulings 
Process Reference Guide  (Issue 4) ,203 Applications for a decision under section  72 is a 
separate process and for information regarding this process see Binding General Ruling 
(BGR) 56 “Application for a Decision under Section 72”, and VAT Section 72 Decision Process 
Reference Guide on the SARS website.

15.3 Terminology 
The following terms are used in this Chapter: 
Applicant: An “applicant” is the person who applies for a VAT class ruling or a VAT ruling (or 
on whose behalf an application is filed). If a representative such as a lawyer or accountant 
files an application on behalf of a third party, that third party is considered th e applicant. 
Similarly, if a person files an application in his or her capacity as a representative taxpayer for 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 141 
another entity such as a company or trust, that other entity is considered the applicant.  The 
application must be accompanied by a Power of Attorney (POA) where an application is filed 
on behalf of the applicant (that is, by a person acting in a representative capacity).  Only one 
applicant applies for a class ruling on behalf of the class. However, a list of the affected class 
members, including their VAT registration numbers (where applicable) is required. 
Application: An “application” is a written request for a VAT ruling on a particular issue 
regarding the tax treatment of a particular transaction. The application must contain all of the 
details set out in section 79(4) [excluding sections 79(4)(f), (k), (6) and 81(1)(b)183F] of the TA Act 
together with the VAT301 form and be submitted by email to VATRulings@sars.gov.za. 
Should an agent, such as a lawyer or accountant, file an application on behalf of a client, a 
Power of Attorney204 or equivalent written statement must be submitted, in terms of which, the 
applicant (client) authorises the agent to file the application and act as the applicant’s 
representative throughout the application and ruling process. A person may also file an 
application in his or her capacity as a representative taxpayer. An application may not be filed 
by or on behalf of a person who is not, or does not intend to be, a party to the proposed or 
past transaction in question. 
Co-applicant: This applies where there is more than one party involved in a transaction, and 
in relation to the requested ruling, the interpretation and application of the tax laws are different 
for the co-applicants. 
Non-binding private opinion: A non-binding private opinion provides informal guidance on the 
VAT treatment of a particular set of facts and circumstances or transaction. A non -binding 
private opinion does not have “binding effect” upon SARS. A non -binding opinion is issued 
under the ATR rules and may therefore be rejected under certain circumstances. 
Proposed transaction: Means a transaction that an applicant proposes to undertake, but has 
not agreed to undertake, other than by way of an agreement that is subject to a suspensive 
condition or is otherwise not binding. 
Sanitised template: A template to be completed and submitted by the applicant upon 
application for a ruling, to assist in streamlining the sanitisation and publication process. 
See the examples on the SARS website (uploaded below this guide). 
Senior SARS official: A SARS official who has specific written authority from the 
Commissioner, or who is occupying a post designated by the Commissioner in writing, to 
exercise powers and duties required by the TA Act. 
VAT301 form: An application form that accompanies the detailed VAT ruling application that 
is applied for under section 41B of the VAT Act. The VAT301 form is available on the SARS 
website. 
15.4 VAT rulings  
15.4.1 VAT rulings application process 
General – Section 41B of the VAT Act provides, in addition to advance rulings under the ATR 
legislation, a legislative framework for the Commissioner to continue issuing binding VAT class 
rulings and VAT rulings as defined in that section. For VAT Rulings, the applicant is not 
 
204 See the SARS website for a template of a Power of Attorney which applicants may use. See also 
the VAT Rulings Process Reference Guide for more information. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 142 
required to pay a fee as required under ATR. Public  Notice 748, as well as the exclusions, 
refusals and rejections contained in section 80(1) of the TA Act also applies to VAT Rulings. 
Making application – All applications for a VAT Ruling must be submitted to SARS by e-mail 
to VATRulings@sars.gov.za or fax number 0860 540 9390 . Submissions received by any 
other means, for example, submissions dropped off at SARS branch offices or e-mailed to any 
SARS official, will not be accepted.  The VAT ruling application must be accompanied by a 
VAT301 form and a signed Power of Attorney form where applicable. The POA and the 
VAT301 must be completed and signed (physical or electronic signature) by the relevant 
authorised persons and must also be signed by a witness. Once the application has been 
received, certain pre-acceptance and compliance requirements will be conducted to determine 
whether the application can be accepted and thereafter allocated to a senior SARS official.. A 
non-compliant application will be rejected if  the applicant fails the pre -acceptance and 
compliance process, the application deals with a matter listed in section  80 of the TA  Act 
including matters listed in Public Notice  748 or the taxpayer is unwilling or unable to provide 
any additional information requested. The  time allocated per VAT R uling depends on the 
complexity of the issue raised in the application. In addition to the VAT301 form and the Power 
of Attorney Form (where applicable) the application must be accompanied by all the relevant 
information, such as –205 
• the applicant’s name, VAT number (if applicable), postal address, contact details (for 
example, phone, or e-mail), and if applicable, the contact details of the applicant’s 
representative; 
• a full and accurate description of the transaction including the financial implications), 
and the impact the transaction might have on the applicant’s VAT liability (or on any 
connected person in relation to the applicant or class member); 
• any other transaction that was entered into before the application was filed or that the 
applicant may enter into after filing the application, if that other transaction may have 
a bearing on the tax consequences of the transaction, or may be considered to be part 
of a series of transactions involving the transaction; 
• the reasons why the applicant believes the specific ruling(s) should be granted the 
relevant statutory provisions or issues, the applicant’s interpretation of those provisions 
as well as an analysis of any relevant authorities that the applicant considered or is 
aware of, whether or not it supports the specific ruling(s) the applicant is seeking;  
• a statement that none of the grounds for the rejection of the application under 
section 80 of the TA Act apply to the application; 
• a statement confirming that the applicant(s) complied with any registration 
requirements under a tax Act with regard to any tax for which the applicant is liable, 
unless the application concerns a ruling to determine an applicant’s liability to register 
under a tax Act; 
• a statement confirming that all tax returns required to be rendered by the applicant 
under a tax Act have been rendered and tax has been paid or arrangements 
acceptable to SARS have been made for the submission of any outstanding returns or 
for the payment of any outstanding tax. In the case of a VAT class ruling application, 
the class representative should provide the aforementioned statement on behalf of the 
class. In the case of a VAT class ruling – 
➢ a description of the class members; and 
 
205 This is not an exhaustive list. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 143 
➢ the impact the transaction might have upon the tax liability of the applicant or 
class members or, if relevant, any connected person in relation to the applicant 
or class member. 
Issuance of a VAT ruling  – A VAT ruling will be issued once the relevant internal review 
processes have been finalised and it has been approved and signed off by the relevant senior 
SARS official. A draft VAT ruling is not provided to the applicant before issuing the VAT ruling. 
The authority to issue a VAT Ruling has been delegated to specific individuals employed within 
the Leveraged Legal Products: Indirect Taxes. Any decision or communication from any other 
functional area within SARS is therefore not a  binding ruling. The VAT ruling will be sent to 
the address and e-mail address that had been provided in the VAT ruling application. 
Publication of rulings – A ruling that is issued (whether positive or negative), may be published 
in a sanitised or redacted form that does not reveal the identity of the applicants. The ruling is 
published by consent of the applicant and is published for general information. From 1 August 
2023, a sanitised template must be completed and submitted by the applicant upon application 
for a ruling, to assist in streamlining the sanitisation and publication process. Examples, with 
notes for completion, are available on the SARS website.  
For information on the requirements on how to apply for a VAT Ruling, see the VAT Rulings 
Process Reference Guide and Chapter 7 of the TA Act. Published BGRs are available on the 
SARS website. 
15.4.2 Applications for apportionment rulings 
A vendor that wants to use an alternative method of apportionment must apply using the 
existing VAT ruling application process, as per the VAT Rulings Process Reference Guide. 
An application to use an alternative method of apportionment, must include the following 
information: 
• A complete description of all the business activities, including whether or not income 
was received from such activities. 
• Details of specific transactions that may impact SARS’s decision-making process (for 
instance, where interest is earned from investment or lending activities, the interest 
rates applicable or alternatives to be used if necessary in specific circumstances). 
• A list of all income streams, including the value thereof, and whether or not such 
income results from various business activities carried on by the business. Also 
indicate whether those income streams are treated as taxable, exempt or out-of-scope 
for VAT purposes. 
• Any possible changes to the business activities or income streams in the past or near 
future that may have an impact on the apportionment ratio. 
• Annual Financial Statements for the past three years. 
• A list of all expenses (including the values thereof) that are – 
➢ directly attributed ( that is, being applied wholly) to the making of taxable 
supplies; 
➢ directly attributed ( that is,  being applied wholly) to the making of exempt 
supplies or for other non -taxable purposes (including income received that 
does not result from a supply made); 
➢ subject to the requested apportionment method, that is, mixed expenses. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 144 
• A detailed explanation as to why – 
➢ apportionment is required, that is, why expenses are regarded as being for 
mixed purposes; 
➢ the standard turnover-based method in BGR 16 is considered not to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances, or why it is inappropriate; 
➢ the proposed alternative method or methods that are considered to be more 
fair and reasonable or appropriate taking into account the specific 
circumstances the enterprise. 
• A clear indication as to the preferred apportionment method and a detailed analysis of 
every inclusion or exclusion in that method. 
• The outcomes and analysis of at least two other apportionment methods considered 
(other than the one in BGR  16) or an explanation as to why any other methods of 
apportionment commonly used by vendors cannot be applied. 
• Detailed calculations of the apportionment ratio for three consecutive years (from the 
latest information available) for the standard turnover -based method and the two 
alternative apportionment methods that have been considered. The calculation must 
clearly indicate how the numbers or values used in the calculations are determined. 
• A statement in the ruling application as to whether input tax has been deducted in past 
tax periods using any method other than the one prescribed in BGR 16, and if so, from 
when that method was applied. 
• A copy of any previous ruling issued within the past five years permitting the vendor to 
use an alternative method of apportionment. 
It is important that all the information referred to above is submitted as part of an application 
to avoid unnecessary delays or the application not being accepted. 
15.5 VAT ruling or a decision? 
A request for the Commissioner to make a decision 206 should be distinguished from an 
application for a VAT Ruling. The main distinction is that a VAT Ruling pertains to the 
interpretation of the VAT Act whereas a decision constitutes the exercising of a discretion 
by the Commissioner. 207 Certain decisions are subject to objection and appeal as set out in 
section 32 and section 104 of the TA Act. 
The difference between a VAT Ruling and a decision is illustrated in Examples 44 and 45 
below: 
Example 44 – Application for a VAT Ruling 
Facts: 
A vendor, supplying marketing services to a non-resident, wants to confirm whether VAT may 
be levied at the zero rate under section 11(2)(l).  
Does the request qualify as an application for a VAT ruling or a decision? 
 
206 See 15.4.4 relating to decisions under section 72. 
207 See section 9 of the TA Act for more information. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 145 
 
Result: 
The question in this case is about the interpretation of the law with reference to a specific set 
of facts relating to the interpretation of section 11(2)(l) with regards to the marketing services. 
The vendor may therefore apply for a VAT Ruling. 
 
Example 45 – Application for a decision 
Facts: 
A vendor, registered to account for VAT on the invoice basis, makes a written application to 
be registered on the payments basis under section  15(2) by completing and submitting the 
prescribed form (Form VAT117). 
Does this request qualify as an application for a VAT ruling or decision? 
Result: 
The Commissioner is required to exercise a discretion in directing that the vendor may be 
registered on the payments basis in accordance with the discretionary power provided in 
section 15(2). The Commissioner will give effect to the decision by changing the accounting 
basis to the payments basis (should the vendor qualify to be registered on the payments basis) 
and notify the vendor accordingly. The application therefore qualifies as  a request for a 
decision. 
In certain instances, the law provides guidance, but does not allow for discretion to be 
exercised. In these instances, the matter cannot be dealt with either as a decision or a VAT 
ruling. 
Example 46 – Application qualifies as neither a VAT Ruling nor a decision 
Facts: 
A vendor supplies holiday accommodation that includes daily transport by road to points of 
interest, for a single consideration. The vendor wants to confirm how to attribute the 
consideration charged partly to the making of the taxable supply (the accommod ation) and 
partly to an exempt supply (the transport of fare-paying passengers) under section 10(22). 
Does the request qualify as an application for a VAT ruling or a decision? 
Result: 
The request does not qualify as an application for either a VAT ruling nor a decision. This is 
on the basis that there is no discretion afforded to the Commissioner as to how to determine 
the different parts of the consideration as contemplated in section 10(22). 
A VAT Ruling is only binding on the Commissioner and as such, it cannot become the subject 
of an objection or appeal, unless it concerns the refusal by the Commissioner to approve a 
special method of apportionment proposed by a vendor to calculate the input tax on 
expenses for both  taxable and non -taxable purposes (mixed purposes)  as contemplated in  
section 17(1), if for some reason, the method as prescribed in BGR 16 “Standard 
Apportionment Method” is not fair and reasonable  in the circumstances .  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 146 
In any other case, i f SARS raises an assessment as a result of the interpretation of the law 
provided in any VAT Ruling, then the assessment itself may be the subject of the objection 
or appeal rather than the ruling itself. If an interpretation given in the ruling is to be 
challenged, then the ruling must be taken on review in the High Court.  
15.5.1 Decisions under section 72  
Since the inception of VAT in South Africa, the VAT Act contained provisions in  
section 72 that provide the Commissioner with the discretionary powers to make 
arrangements or decisions as to the manner in which the provisions of the VAT Act shall be 
applied, subject to certain requirements being met.  
Challenges regarding the application of the mandatory wording of the other provisions of the 
VAT Act versus the discretionary wording of the provisions of section 72 arose. In order to 
address those concerns, section 72 was amended to align the wording with the construct 
and policy intent of the other provisions of the VAT Act. The amendments to section 72 were 
introduced by Act 34 of 2019 with effect from 21  July 2019.  
The effect of the amendments to section 72 is to limit the extent of the Commissioner’s 
discretion in making a decision under this section . This is done, for example, by clarifying 
the circumstances under which the provision can be invoked and by aligning the wording more 
generally with the construct and policy intent of the VAT Act as a whole, as well as any specific 
provisions in the VAT Act which might be applicable in the circumstances. 
As a result of the amendments, no decision can be given under section 72 which –  
• has the effect of reducing or increasing the liability for tax levied under the VAT Act; or 
• is contrary to the construct and policy intent of the VAT Act as a whole or any specific 
provision thereof. 
Certain provisions 208 relating to Advance Rulings were also introduced in the amended 
section 72 to align with the process of application and issuing of decisions under section 72.  
These include, amongst others – 
• to introduce a prescribed application fee of R2 500 in respect of any application for a 
decision under section 72 in accordance with section 81 of the TA Act read with 
VAT Notice 299;209 
• the issuing, in accordance with section 90 of the TA Act, of procedures and guidelines 
in the form of BGRs for the implementation and operation of the process to obtain a 
decision under section 72. 
In addition, under section 72(3) read with VAT Notice 300, the Commissioner may decline 
to make a decision in respect of the list of transactions set out in the said Public Notice.  
The ATR eFiling system is used to facilitate the administrative process of receiving 
applications for a decision under section 72, including the levying and receipt of the required 
application fee. Subsequent to this initial process, the application will be considered and 
finalised by Leveraged Legal Products.  
 
208 Sections 75, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89 and 90 of the TA Act. 
209  Public Notice 299 “Application and cost recovery fees for binding private rulings and binding class 
rulings under section 81 of the Act and section 72 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1991” was published 
on 1 April 2021 in GG 44383 and came into effect from that date. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 15 
 
 147 
A section 72 decision that is issued (whether positive or negative), may be published in a 
sanitised or redacted form that does not reveal the identity of the applicants.  
Refer to BGR 56 : “ Application for a decision under section 72” t hat prescribes the 
requirements and conditions relating to an application for a decision under section 72, as 
well as the updated VAT Section 72 Decisions Process Reference Guide.  
As mentioned in VAT Connect – Issue 10 (March 2020), the changes to the wording of 
section 72 only apply to new applications made on or after 21 July 2019. Therefore, any 
arrangement or decision made by the Commissioner before that date, remains valid until the 
earlier of the following dates:  
• The stated expiry date of that decision (as contained in VAT Rulings, and BGRs;  
• 31 December 2021; or  
• The effective date of any amendment in the legislation that affects the previous 
arrangement or decision (refer for example to the article “Non-resident lessors of 
ships, aircraft and rolling stock under a rental agreement” in VAT Connect 
(Issue 12).  
All decisions under section 72 that do not have a stated expiry date before 31 December 2021, 
also ceased to apply from the said date . This includes VAT Rulings and BGRs containing 
decisions under section 72 (Rulings). 
The effect of the above is that affected vendors or classes of vendors will no longer be able to 
rely on these Rulings to the extent that they contain a decision under section 72. Refer to VAT 
Connect – Issue 12 (June 2021) and VAT Connect – Issue 13 (November 2021) for further 
details regarding section 72 in general, as well as the specific implications of the expiration of 
existing section 72 decisions.

Chapter 16  
Tax Administration Act 
16.1 Introduction 
A brief summary of the TA Act is provided below, which expands upon certain administrative 
matters which have not necessarily been dealt with in any of the other chapters, but which are 
necessary to mention as they impact on the general administration of the VAT Act. 
16.2 Interpretation 
The following rules apply to the application of the TA Act: 
• Firstly, the TA Act regulates the administration of all the tax Acts and a specific tax Act 
must then be read together with the TA Act. 
• Secondly, if there is an administrative provision in a tax Act and the TA Act is silent in 
this regard, then the specific administrative provision in the tax Act must apply. If the 
tax Act is silent about an administrative process, or a right that a taxpayer has, or the 
power or the authority of SARS, then the provision in the TA Act must be used.  
• Thirdly, if a tax Act uses a term that is defined in that tax Act, that meaning must be 
applied. This rule also applies when there is an inconsistency between a term that is 
used in a tax Act and the TA Act, however, this rule will not apply if the context in which 
the term is used in the TA Act indicates that the TA Act meaning must be applied. 
• Fourthly, if there is any inconsistency between a tax Act and the TA Act, the tax Act 
will prevail. 
See the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 2011 for more information is this regard. 
16.3 Practice generally prevailing 
If SARS has a practice which is generally prevailing, a vendor has an expectation that SARS 
will follow that practice in similar circumstances for every vendor. The meaning of the term 
“practice generally prevailing” has been dealt with in numerous cases, sometimes with 
conflicting outcomes. For this reason, vendors were often unsure of the existence of a practice 
generally prevailing as a result of reliance on certain non-SARS publications. In order to give 
certainty to the meaning of this term, it is now defined in the TA Act.210 
The TA Act defines a practice set out in an official publication as a practice generally 
prevailing. Official publications are issued by either a senior SARS official who is specifically 
designated as such by the Commissioner or by the Commissioner him or herself and include – 
• Binding General Rulings; 
• Interpretation Notes; 
• Practice Notes; or  
• Public notices. 
 
 210 Section 5 of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 16 
 
 149 
Any practice contained in a publication and documents which do not reflect the application or 
interpretation of a tax Act that is binding on, and generally applied by the whole of SARS is 
not a practice generally prevailing and can therefore not be relied upon by vendors. Examples 
of documents which do not constitute official publications include, but are not limited to – 
• this guide or any other guide issued on a specific matter;  
• media releases, published articles; and 
• operational practices or procedures. 
The concept of “practice generally prevailing” is used in the TA Act in the context of both 
defining and limiting SARS’s power to issue an additional or reduced assessment and placing 
limitations upon vendors in claiming refunds. In essence, an assessment will always be viewed 
in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time of the assessment. This means 
that SARS cannot reassess (that is raise an additional or reduced assessment) if the practice 
generally prevailing is altered subsequent to the assessment. The practice generally prevailing 
at the time of assessment, applies. 
The TA Act also deals with the situation in which a practice generally prevailing no longer 
applies. For example, a legislative amendment or judgment handed down on a matter may 
have a material effect on the extent to which SARS can justify the continuation of that practice. 
In response, SARS must decide whether the practice has become obsolete or unnecessary, 
or that it should be changed in favour of a different practice. However, should SARS appeal a 
judgment which materially changes a practice generally prevailing, that practice will remain 
valid and applicable until the final outcome of the appeal. 
16.4 Registration 
Chapter 3 of the TA Act regulates the registration of vendors. The management of vendor 
registration involves three basic functions: the creation of a registration for a vendor, updating 
vendor details and the deregistration of vendors from SARS’s records. To encourage 
compliance with registration obligations, the TA Act seeks to provide a clear and 
comprehensive description of registration requirements. SARS further seeks to make the 
procedural requirements for registration as easy as possible. As part of modernisation 
initiatives, SARS implemented the single registration process for all tax types which came into 
effect on 12  May 2014 . For more information refer to the SARS website on the single 
registration process.  
A change to the address, banking account, or representative (after registration) of the vendor 
must be communicated to SARS within 21 business days of the change.  See Chapter 2 for 
more information in this regard.  SARS will also take measures to ensure completeness of 
vendor registrations, that is, to ensure that vendors who fail to register or provide adequate 
information are detected. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 16 
 
 150 
16.5 Record-keeping 
The TA Act211 imposes a duty on a person to retain the records, books of accounts or 
documents needed to comply with a tax Act. Vendors are also required to keep additional 
specific records under section 55 of the VAT Act. 
The duty to retain records does not only rest on vendors who are registered and who have 
filed a return, but is extended to include those who ought to, but have not filed a return, and 
those who would have been obliged to file a return if not for an exemption or threshold. Failure 
or neglect to retain proper records as required under the TA Act is a criminal offence 212 and 
may trigger administrative non-compliance penalties under Chapter 15 of the TA Act. 
See Chapter 13 for more information on the electronic retention of records and the  Short 
Guide on the Tax Administration Act, 2011 for more information on record -keeping and the 
relevant periods applicable. 
16.5.1 Unannounced inspections 
SARS officials are empowered under the TA Act to conduct an inspection at a vendor’s place 
of business without prior notice. The object of these unannounced inspections is to determine 
whether a vendor is registered for tax purposes, to ascertain if the vendor keeps records as 
required, or to determi ne the identity of the person occupying the premises. This type of 
inspection can only be conducted in instances where a SARS official has a reasonable belief 
that a trade or enterprise is carried on, at the premises to be inspected. These SARS officials 
are not allowed to enter any domestic premises or dwelling which is not used for purposes of 
carrying on a trade or enterprise. 
Further, all SARS officials involved in the administration of a tax Act must be issued with an 
identity card which he or she must produce when required to do so by a member of the public. 
This card is used to, when requested, demonstrate the authority of a SARS official to perform 
functions or duties. This ensures that SARS officials are not impersonated and that the public 
is satisfied that they are dealing with a SARS official and know the identity of that official. 
16.6 Verifications and audits 
Verifications 
The process of verification is a less intensive process than an audit although it entails the 
evaluation of the accuracy of the vendor’s records. Records that might be used to verify the 
details on a return include the supporting documents relating to the input tax deductions made 
or output tax declared, or any other records or documents which may be relevant in the 
circumstances (including information from third parties). SARS officials t rained in VAT will 
conduct the verification. You will be notified of the request to submit supporting documents 
within a short period after submitting the actual return. The requested documents should be 
submitted to SARS in a manner specified in the request. 
The supporting documents are usually requested to be uploaded via the eFiling channel, by 
post or by delivery at the nearest SARS office. You may select the format accessible to you to 
submit the documents from the aforementioned options. The scope of the verification is 
generally limited to a single VAT period and will probably be the latest period. 
 
211 Section 30 of the TA Act. 
212 Section 234(e) of the TA Act. 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Chapter 16 
 
 151 
What is an audit? 
An audit is generally a detailed check on the correctness of VAT returns submitted and 
payments made by you. It will normally involve an examination of multiple periods, and 
relevant materials may be obtained from third parties as well as from the vendor. A SARS 
official will contact you as and when an audit needs to be conducted and a notification of the 
intention to conduct an audit will be issued. An audit is conducted based on the risk profile of 
a vendor and the scope of the audit will be communicated in the first notification received from 
the auditor. 
What happens during the auditing process? 
The TA Act provides that a vendor must be kept informed of the progress of an audit at regular 
intervals. The Commissioner has issued Public Notice  788213 prescribing when reports need 
to be issued. At the conclusion of the audit, a notice is required to be issued explaining any 
proposed material adjustments to be made and the vendor has the right to respond to the 
notice within 21 business days. The time periods may be extended by consent and SARS may 
deviate from the process if strict compliance may impede the progress or outcome of an audit. 
How are vendors selected for audits? 
Chapter 5 of the TA Act provides the basis upon which a person may be selected for an 
inspection or verification which can be any consideration relevant for the proper administration 
of a tax Act, including a random or risk assessment basis. This is not the basis for criminal 
investigations which are triggered by indications of an offence under the tax Acts. The TA Act 
also prescribes procedures that SARS has to follow both during and after an audit. For more 
detailed information, see the Short Guide to the Tax Administration Act, 2011. Under certain 
conditions, vendors who have been subjected to audits or investigations may apply for relief 
under the voluntary disclosure programme . H owever, certain requirements must be met 
before such an application will be accepted.214

Glossary 
Association not 
for gain 
An “association not for gain” is essentially a religious institution or other 
society, association or organisation (including an educational institution of 
a public character) which is not carried on for profit and is required to use 
any property or income solely in the furtherance of its aims and objects. An 
association not for gain could also qualify as a “welfare organisation” if it 
conducts certain activities. The VAT 414 – Guide for Associations not for 
Gain and Welfare Organisations deals specifically with associations not for 
gain and welfare organisations. 
Commercial 
accommodation 
There are three types of commercial accommodation, namely: 
• Lodging or board and lodging together with domestic goods and 
services in any house, flat, apartment, room, hotel, motel, inn, 
guesthouse residential establishment, holiday accommodation unit, 
chalet, tent, caravan, campsite, houseboat or similar establishment. 
This must be supplied regularly and systematically, excluding a 
“dwelling” supplied for letting or hiring thereof [as this is an exempt 
supply under section 12(c)]. 
• Lodging or board and lodging in a home for the aged, children, 
physically or mentally handicapped persons. 
• Lodging or board and lodging in a hospice. 
Connected 
person 
The term includes but is not limited to: family relatives, partnerships, trust 
beneficiaries, branches of the same legal entity, companies with 
substantially the same shareholders. This term describes and identifies the 
relationships between different pers ons. The term is important because if 
persons are connected in terms of the definition, it may be necessary to 
apply special time and value of supply rules where the supplier may be 
required to charge VAT on the OMV of the supply, rather than on the 
amount of consideration received.  Other examples include the following 
(amongst others): 
• Natural persons who are related by blood or marriage. 
• A company and any subsidiaries of that company. 
• Any CC and its members. 
• A natural person and a company where that natural person owns 
more than 10% of the shares or voting rights in that company. 
  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary 
 
 153 
Consideration  This is generally the total amount of money (incl. VAT) received for a 
supply. For barter transactions where the consideration is not in money, the 
consideration will be the OMV of goods or services (incl. VAT) received for 
making the taxable supply. Secti on 10 determines the value of supply or 
amount of the consideration for VAT purposes for different types of 
supplies. 
Any act of forbearance whether voluntary or not, for the inducement of a 
supply of goods or services will constitute consideration, but it excludes any 
donation made as an unconditional gift to an association not for gain. Also 
excluded is a “deposit” which is lodged to secure a future supply of goods 
and held in trust until the time of the supply. Since VAT is the difference 
between the selling price including the VAT and the value of the taxable 
supply, the following formulae can be derived: 
 
 
 
   
Domestic 
goods and 
services 
This includes the following when they are supplied together with commercial 
accommodation: 
• Cleaning and maintenance 
• Electricity, gas, air conditioning or heating 
• Use of a telephone, television set, radio or other similar article 
• Furniture and other fittings 
• Meals 
• Laundry 
• Nursing services 
• Water 
(The list is not exhaustive.) 
When a person stays for longer than 28  days in any hotel, guesthouse, inn, 
boarding house, retirement home, or similar establishment, only 60% of an 
all-inclusive charge for accommodation and domestic goods or services will 
be subject to VAT. [See 5.3.4 for more information]. 
Should the charges for domestic goods and services not form part of the all-
inclusive charge, these separately itemised supplies will attract VAT at the 
standard rate on the full value. 
Donation  This is where a gratuitous payment (donation) is voluntarily made to any 
association not for gain for the carrying on or the carrying out of the purposes 
of that association and in respect of which no identifiable direct valuable 
benefit arises or may arise in the form of a supply of goods or services to the 
person making that payment. The term also includes not only cash payments, 
but also the value of goods or services donated. This term is dealt with in 
more detail in the VAT 414 – Guide for Associations not for Gain and Welfare 
Organisations. 
  
VAT = consideration – value 
or 
Consideration = value + VAT 
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary 
 
 154 
Dwelling This is any building, premises, structure, or any other place or part thereof 
used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any natural person 
(or which is intended for this purpose), including any fixtures and fittings 
belonging thereto and enjoyed therewith. 
Enterprise Any business activity in the broadest sense. It includes any activity carried 
on – 
• continuously or regularly; 
• by any person; 
• in or partly in the RSA; 
• in the course or furtherance of which goods or services are supplied 
for a consideration to another person, that is, some form of payment; 
• whether or not for profit. 
Special inclusions: 
• Public authorities – certain government departments and provincial 
authorities 
• Municipalities  
• Welfare organisations and FDFPs215 
• Share-block companies 
• Non-residents supplying certain electronic services (this includes the 
activities of local and non-resident intermediaries) where at least two 
out of three of the following circumstances apply, namely: 1. The 
electronic services are supplied to a South African resident, 2. 
Payment originates from the RSA, or 3. The recipient has an address 
(that is business, postal or residential) in the RSA. 
The following activities are not “enterprise” activities and will therefore not 
attract VAT: 
• Services rendered by an employee to an employer for example, 
salary/wage/remuneration earners. This must however be 
distinguished from a private independent contractor who is not 
excluded 
• Supplies by a branch or main business permanently located outside 
the RSA (must be separately identifiable and maintain its own system 
of accounting) 
• Private or recreational pursuits or hobbies (unless carried on like a 
business) 
• Private occasional transactions for example, occasional sale of 
domestic/household goods, personal effects or private motor vehicle 
• Any exempt supplies (listed in section 12) 
• The supply of commercial accommodation 216 of a value of less than 
R120 000 per annum.  
  
 
215  The definition of “enterprise” was amended to include reference to the activities of an implementing 
agency in respect of the FDFP activities rather than to regard the FDFP as a “person”.  
216 Paragraph (a) of commercial accommodation in section 1(1).

Entertainment  The term “entertainment” means the provision of any food, beverages, 
accommodation, entertainment, amusement, recreation or hospitality of any 
kind by a vendor whether directly or indirectly to anyone in connection with 
an enterprise carried on by that person. As a general rule expenses relating 
to entertainment may not be deducted as input tax. There are, however, 
some exceptions to the rule. 
Examples of entertainment include the following: 
• Staff refreshments such as tea, coffee and other beverages and 
snacks and other ingredients purchased in order to provide meals to 
staff, clients and business associates 
• Catering services acquired for staff canteens and dining rooms 
including own equipment, furniture and utensils used in kitchens, 
canteens and staff dining rooms 
• Christmas lunches and parties, including the hire of venues 
• Golf days for customers and clients 
• Beverages, meals and other hospitality and entertainment supplied to 
customers and clients at product launches and other promotional 
events 
• Entertainment of customers and clients in restaurants, theatres and 
night clubs 
• Capital goods such as hospitality boxes, holiday houses, yachts and 
private aircraft used for entertainment 
(The list is not exhaustive) 
Exempt supply An exempt supply is a supply on which no VAT may be charged (even if the 
supplier is registered for VAT). Persons making only exempt supplies may 
not register for VAT and may not recover input tax on purchases to make 
exempt supplies. 
Section 12 contains a list of exempt supplies. 
Exempt supplies include: 
• certain “financial services” as defined; 
• supplies by any "association not for gain" of any donated goods or 
services or any other goods made or manufactured by such 
association if at least 80% of the value of the materials used in making 
or manufacturing such other goods consists of donated goods; 
• rental of accommodation in any "dwelling" including employee 
housing; 
• certain educational services;  
• services of employee organisations for example, trade unions; 
• certain services to members of a sectional title, share block or old age 
scheme funded out of levies. (Not applicable to timeshare schemes); 
• public road and railway transport of fare-paying passengers and their 
luggage; and 
• childcare services in a crèche or after-school care centre.  
 
  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary 
 
 156 
 
Goods The term “goods” includes – 
• corporeal (tangible) movable things, goods in the ordinary sense 
(including any real right in those things); 
• fixed property, land and buildings (including any real right in the 
property, for example, servitudes, mineral rights, notarial leases); 
• sectional title units (including timeshare); 
• shares in a share block company; 
• postage stamps;  
• electricity; and 
• second-hand goods. 
The term “goods” excludes – 
• money, that is, notes, coins, cheques, bills of exchange (except 
when sold as a collector’s item); 
• value cards, revenue stamps etc which are used to pay taxes 
(except when sold as a collector’s item); and 
• any right under a mortgage bond. 
Instalment 
credit 
agreement 
(ICA) 
There are two types of ICAs, namely, an instalment sale agreement and an 
instalment lease agreement. These  agreements are characterised by a 
suspensive condition as to the passing of ownership of the goods or services 
supplied. The agreement will normally provide for the payment of the 
purchase price including finance charges at a fixed or determinable charge 
and the recipient accepts the risks attached to those goods insofar as loss or 
damage is concerned. In the case of an instalment lease agreement, the term 
of the agreement must be at least 12 months. 
Input tax This includes, amongst others, the tax paid by the recipient to the supplier of 
goods or services, the VAT paid on the importation of goods and includes 
notional input tax on second-hand goods. Input tax may only be deducted by 
the recipient vendor if the goods or services are acquired for making taxable 
supplies and if the vendor is in possession of the relevant documentary proof 
under section 16(2)(a) to (e). Under section 16(2)(g) a vendor may in certain 
circumstances deduct input tax based on alternative documentary evidence 
acceptable to the Commissioner in terms of a ruling issued by the 
Commissioner. 
An apportionment of input tax must be made if goods or services are acquired 
only partly for making taxable supplies. 
In the case of an importation, where the bill of entry or other documentation 
prescribed by the Customs and Excise Act reflect the vendor as the importer, 
the vendor must be in possession of such document together with the receipt 
for the payment of the VAT in relation to the importation of the goods and the 
EDI Customs Status 1 Release Message. Should the vendor not be in 
possession of the aforementioned documentation, it must in terms of 
section 54(3)(b) be in possession of the statement issued by the agent when 
deducting input tax under section 16(3)(a)(iii) or(b)(ii). 
  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary 
 
 157 
 In the case of second-hand goods acquired by the vendor, the vendor must 
retain a proper record of the details of the transaction on VAT264 Form. 
Should the second -hand goods acquired constitute fixed property, the 
transfer of which requires registration in a Deeds Registry, input tax may only 
be deducted once the property has been registered in the name of the vendor 
claiming a deduction and is limited to the extent that the consideration for the 
property has been paid. 
As a general rule, input tax may not be deducted on supplies of 
“entertainment”, motor cars and club subscriptions. Input tax may also not be 
deducted where goods or services are acquired for the purpose of making 
exempt supplies, for private use or for other non-taxable activities. 
Motor car 
 
 
“Motor car” is a defined term which includes vehicles which have three or 
more wheels, are normally used on public roads and which are constructed 
or converted wholly or mainly for carrying passengers. As a general rule input 
tax may not be deducted on the acquisition of a motor car, irrespective of the 
mode of acquisition or whether or not it is used for taxable supplies. 
Examples of passenger vehicles on which input tax cannot be deducted 
include ordinary motor cars, SUVs, double-cab bakkies (LDVs), microbuses 
that are capable of carrying passengers.  
The following vehicles do not qualify as a “motor car” as defined:  
• Vehicles capable of accommodating more than 16 persons (for 
example, a bus) 
• Specialised vehicles such as hysters, graders, tractors, mobile 
cranes, earthmoving vehicles (seats only 1 person)  
• Ambulances and caravans 
• Vehicles with an unladen mass of 3500 kg or more 
• Single cab bakkies (LDVs) /Trucks/ Lorries/Delivery Vehicles 
• Hearses and game viewing vehicles 
Official 
publication 
This means a binding general ruling , interpretation note, practice note or 
public notice issued by a senior SARS official or the Commissioner. Guides 
which SARS issues from time -to-time for information purposes only do not 
fall within the meaning of “official publication”.  
Output tax The tax (VAT) charged by a vendor on a taxable supply of goods or services. 
  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary 
 
 158 
Person  This term refers to the entity which is liable for VAT registration and includes

Public notice This means a notice issued by the Commissioner and published in the GG. 
The TA Act and VAT Act includes the regulations and public notices issued 
thereunder, which will have the status of subordinate legislation. 
Relevant 
material 
The information gathering powers of SARS may only be used to obtain 
relevant material. Relevant material is information, documents, or things that 
are foreseeably relevant for tax risk assessment, assessing and collecting 
tax, or for determining compliance with a tax obligation. 
SARS official SARS official is a defined term in the TA Act and means –  
• the Commissioner; 
• an employee of SARS; or 
• a person contracted by SARS for purposes of the administration of a 
tax Act and who carries out the provisions of a tax Act under the 
control, direction or supervision of the Commissioner. 
Second-hand 
goods 
Second-hand goods are goods (including fixed property) that have been 
previously owned and used. The term excludes certain things for example, 
animals, gold, gold coins, and “old order” mining rights. Vendors trading in 
goods containing gold which are sold in substantially the same state as when 
those goods were acquired, may be entitled to a deduction of notional input 
tax in certain circumstances. 
  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary 
 
 159 
Services The term “services” is very broad and includes – 
• the granting, assignment, cession, surrender of any right; 
• the making available of any facility or advantage; and  
• certain acts which are deemed to be services under section 8. 
The term excludes – 
• a supply of “goods”; 
• money; and 
• any stamp, form or card which falls into the definition of “goods”. 
Examples: 
• Commercial services – electricians, plumbers, builders 
• Professional services – doctors, accountants, lawyers 
• Advertising agencies 
• Intellectual property rights – patents, trademarks, copy rights, know-
how 
• Restraint of trade 
• Cover under an insurance contract 
Supply This definition is very wide and includes all forms of supply (including the 
expropriation of fixed property), irrespective of where the supply is effected, 
and any derivative of supply is construed accordingly. 
Tax invoice 
 
This is a special document which is required to be held by a vendor to deduct 
input tax. The term is dealt with in section 20 which prescribes that where the 
consideration is R5 000 or more, or is a zero -rated supply a full tax invoice 
must be issued with the following information reflected thereon: 
• The words “tax invoice”, “VAT invoice” or “invoice”  
• Name, address and VAT registration number of the supplier 
• Name, address and VAT registration number of the recipient 
• Serial number and date of issue 
• Full and proper description of goods and/or services supplied 
• Quantity or volume of goods or services supplied 
• Price and VAT 
Where the amount (including VAT) is less than R5  000, an abridged tax 
invoice may be issued which has the same requirements as above, except 
that the name, address and VAT registration number of the recipient and the 
quantity or volume do not need to be specified. 
In certain cases, a tax invoice is not required to be issued and there are also 
some special rules which apply in other cases. For example, the 
requirements for tax invoices in respect of electronic services supplied by 
non-residents are prescribed in GN 1594 in GG 45324 dated 10 December 
2021.   
  
VAT 404 – Guide for Vendors Glossary

Tax period  There are five different tax periods as follows: 
• Category A – two-monthly (ending at the end of every odd month). 
For example, Jan, Mar, May, July 
• Category B – two-monthly (ending at the end of every even month). 
For example, February, April, June 
• Category C – monthly (taxable supplies greater than R30 million in 
any consecutive period of 12 months) 
• Category D – six-monthly (certain farmers and micro-businesses – 
taxable supplies less than R1,5 million in any consecutive period of 
12 months) 
• Category E – annually (only in exceptional circumstances for 
connected persons with only one transaction per consecutive period 
of 12 months) 
Taxable supply This is a supply (including a zero-rated supply) which is chargeable with tax 
under the VAT  Act. A taxable supply does not include any exempt supply 
listed in section 12, even if supplied by a registered vendor. 
There are two types of taxable supplies, namely – 
• those which attract the zero rate (listed in section 11); and 
• those on which the standard rate must be charged. 
Vendor This includes any person who is registered or is required to be registered 
for VAT. However, where the Commissioner has determined the date from 
which a person is a vendor, a person shall be a vendor from that date.
