•  from interest, dividends, foreign dividends, rental from 
the letting of fixed property, and remuneration from an 
unregistered employer, will be R30 000 or less for the tax

Savings Withdrawal Benefits    
On 1 September 2024 a new retirement system was introduced 
that allocates retirement savings of members between a 
retirement component, a savings component and a vested 
component. Any withdrawal from the savings component is 
taxed at the member’s marginal tax rate.
Dividends
Dividends received by individuals from South African 
companies are generally exempt from income tax, but 
dividends tax, at a rate of 20%, is withheld by the entities 
paying the dividends to the individuals. Dividends received 
by South African resident individuals from REITs (listed and 
regulated property-owning companies) are subject to income 
tax, and non-residents in receipt of those dividends are only 
subject to dividends tax.
Foreign Dividends
Most foreign dividends received by individuals from foreign 
companies (shareholding of less than 10% in the foreign 
company) are taxable at a maximum effective rate of 20%. No 
deductions are allowed for expenditure to produce foreign 
dividends.
Interest Exemptions
 
Interest from a South African source, earned by any natural 
person under 65 years of age or an estate of a deceased person, 
up to R23 800 per annum, and persons who are 65 years 
and older, up to R34 500 per annum, is exempt from income 
tax. Interest earned by non-residents, who not physically 
present in South Africa for more than 183 days during the 
12-month period before the interest accrues or is received, 
if the interest-bearing debt is not effectively connected to a 
permanent establishment (such as a fixed place of business) in 
South Africa, is exempt from income tax.
Deductions
Retirement fund contributions
Amounts contributed to pension, provident and retirement 
annuity funds during a year of assessment are deductible by 
members of those funds. Amounts contributed by employers 
and taxed as fringe benefits are treated as contributions by 
the individual employees. The deduction is limited to 27.5% 
of the greater of the amount of remuneration for employees’ 
tax purposes or taxable income (both excluding retirement 
fund lump sums and severance benefits). The deduction is 
further limited to the lower of R350 000 or 27.5% of taxable 
income, before the inclusion of a taxable capital gain. Any 
contributions exceeding the limitations are carried forward 
to the immediately following year of assessment, and are 
deemed to be contributed in that following year. The amounts 
carried forward are reduced by contributions set off against 
retirement fund lump sums and retirement annuities
Medical and disability expenses
In determining tax payable, individuals are allowed to deduct 
a rebate based on:
•  Monthly contributions to medical schemes by the 
individual who paid the contributions up to R364 for 
each of the first two persons covered by those medical 
schemes, and R246 for each additional dependent. This 
rebate is referred to as a medical scheme fees tax credit; 
and
in the case of:
•  An individual who is 65 years and older, or if an individual, 
his or her spouse, or his or her child is a person with a 
disability, 33.3% of the sum of qualifying medical expenses 
paid and borne by the individual, and an amount by which 
medical scheme contributions paid by the individual 
exceed three times the medical scheme fees tax credits 
for the tax year; or
•  Any other individual, 25% of an amount equal to the sum 
of the qualifying medical expenses paid and borne by 
the individual, and an amount by which medical scheme 
contributions paid by the individual exceed four times the 
medical scheme fees tax credits for the tax year, limited 
to the amount that exceeds 7.5% of taxable income 
(excluding retirement fund lump sums and severance 
benefits).
  This rebate is referred to as an additional medical 
expenses tax credit.
Donations
Deductions in respect of donations to certain public benefit 
organisations are limited to 10% of taxable income (excluding 
retirement fund lump sums and severance benefits). The 
amount of donations exceeding 10% of the taxable income is 
treated as a donation to qualifying public benefit organisations 
in the following tax year.
Allowances
Subsistence allowances and advances
Where the recipient is obliged to spend at least one night away 
from his or her usual place of residence on business, and the 
accommodation to which that allowance or advance relates is 
in the Republic of South Africa, and the allowance or advance 
is granted to pay for:
•  Meals and incidental costs, an amount of R570 is deemed to 
have been expended per day; or
•  Incidental costs only, an amount of R176 is deemed to have 
been expended per day.
Where the accommodation to which that allowance or 
advance relates is outside the Republic of South Africa, 
a specific amount per country is deemed to have been 
expended. Details of these amounts are published on the SARS  
website (www.sars.gov.za), under Legal Counsel/Secondary 
Legislation/ Income T ax Notices/2024/Notice 4458, published 
on 1 March 2024.
Where the recipient is, by reason of the duties of his or her office 
or employment, obliged to spend a part of a day away from his 
or her usual place of work or employment, a reimbursement 
or advance for expenditure actually incurred by the recipient 
is exempt if the recipient is allowed by his or her principal to 
incur expenditure on meals and other incidental costs for that 
part of the day, and the amount of the reimbursement does not 
exceed R176.
Travelling allowance
Rates per kilometre, which may be used in determining the 
allowable deduction for business travel against an allowance 
or advance where actual costs are not claimed, are determined 
using the following table:
Value of the vehicle
(including V AT) (R)
Fixed cost
(R p.a.)
Fuel cost
(c/km)
Maintenance
cost (c/km)
0 - 100 000 33 940 146.7 47.4
100 001 - 200 000 60 688 163.8 59.3
200 001 - 300 000 87 497 177.9 65.4
300 001 - 400 000 111 273 191.4 71.4
400 001 - 500 000     135 048 204.8 83.9
500 001 - 600 000     159 934 234.9 98.5
600 001 - 700 000     184 867 238.9 110.5
700 001 - 800 000     211 121 242.9 122.5
exceeding 800 000    211 121 242.9 122.5
Note:
•  Eighty per cent of the travelling allowance must be 
included in the employee’s remuneration for the purposes 
of calculating PAYE. The percentage is reduced to 20% if 
the employer is satisfied that at least 80% of the use of the 
motor vehicle for the tax year will be for business purposes.
•  No fuel cost may be claimed if the employee has not borne 
the full cost of fuel used in the vehicle, and no maintenance 
cost may be claimed if the employee has not borne the full 
cost of maintaining the vehicle (e.g., if the vehicle is covered 
by a maintenance plan).
•  The fixed cost must be reduced on a pro-rata basis if the 
vehicle is not used for business purposes for a full year.
•  The actual distance travelled during a tax year, and the 
distance travelled for business purposes, substantiated 
by a logbook, are used to determine the costs that may be 
claimed against a travelling allowance.
Alternatively:
Where an allowance or advance is based on the actual distance 
travelled by the employee for business purposes, no tax is 
payable on an allowance paid by an employer to an employee, 
up to R4.76 per kilometre, regardless of the value of the vehicle.
However, this alternative is not available if other compensation 
in the form of an allowance or reimbursement (other than for 
parking or toll fees) is received from the employer in respect 
of the vehicle.

Other Deductions
Other than the deductions set out above, an individual may only 
claim deductions against employment income or allowances in 
limited specified situations, e.g., bad debt in respect of salary.
Fringe Benefits
Employer-owned vehicles
•  The taxable value is 3.5% of the determined value (the cash 
cost, including Value-added T ax) of each vehicle per month. 
Where the vehicle is:
»  The subject of a maintenance plan when the employer 
acquired it, the taxable value is 3,25% of the determined 
value; or
»  Acquired by the employer under an operating lease, the 
taxable value is the cost incurred by the employer under 
the operating lease plus the cost of fuel.
•  Eighty per cent of the fringe benefit must be included in the 
employee’s remuneration for the purposes of calculating 
PAYE. The percentage is reduced to 20% if the employer is 
satisfied that at least 80% of the use of the motor vehicle 
for the tax year will be for business purposes.
•  On assessment, the fringe benefit for the tax year is reduced 
by the ratio of the distance travelled for business purposes, 
substantiated by a logbook, divided by the actual distance 
travelled during the tax year.
•  On assessment, there is further relief for the cost of the 
licence, insurance, maintenance and fuel for private travel, 
if the full cost thereof has been borne by the employee and if 
the distance travelled for private purposes is substantiated 
by a logbook.
Interest-free or low-interest loans
The difference between interest charged at the official rate 
and the actual amount of interest charged is to be included in 
gross income.
Residential accommodation
•  The value of the fringe benefit to be included in gross 
income is the lower of the benefit calculated by applying 
a prescribed formula, or the cost to the employer 
if the employer does not have full ownership of the 
accommodation.
•  The formula will apply if the accommodation is owned by the 
employee, but it does not apply to holiday accommodation 
hired by the employer from non-associated institutions.

South African-licensed exchanges. Dividends are tax exempt 
if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a South African

resident beneficial owners of dividends may benefit from 
reduced tax rates in limited circumstances. The tax is to be 
withheld by companies that pay the taxable dividends, or by 
regulated intermediaries in the case of dividends on listed 
shares. The tax on dividends in kind (other than in cash) is

of immovable property in South Africa, to be set off against the 
normal tax liability of the non-residents. The tax to be withheld 
from payments to the non-residents is at a rate of 7.5% for a 
non-resident individual, 10% for a non-resident company, and 
15% for a non-resident trust that is selling the immovable
